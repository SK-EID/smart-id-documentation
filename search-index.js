Having a correct certificate is needed for giving signatures under *AdES schemes. The method should not be used if the signature scheme does not mandate presence of the certificate in the document structure that is to be signed. A Smart-ID user can have multiple active accounts and document number is the unique identifier for a specific Smart-ID account. If an RP has previously done authentication flow for a user, the next signature request should use certificatechoice with the obtained document number, so that the RP can immediately get user’s correct certificate without interaction from the user. In case the certificatechoice with the identifier is used, e.g. in case of a signature request with no prior authentication, the RP must immediately use the notification based signature session after receiving the certificate. This is because when the Smart-ID app receives a certificatechoice session, it will service the request and then stay in the foreground and wait for the notification based signature session for a seamless user experience. A quick guide to choosing which certificatechoice endpoint to use: if a prior authentication was recently completed and a documentnumber was received, use the certificatechoice endpoint with documentnumber; if some time has passed from last authentication (more than a day), it is recommended to use the certificatechoice endpoint referencing a user identifier, not a specific account (and not refer to a specific documentnumber); if there is no prior authentication, the certificatechoice endpoint referencing a user identifier must be used.

The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS ciphersuite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint is valid (not expired, signed by trusted CA and not revoked).

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases, i.e. authentication and signing. The main Smart-ID use case is of a relying party to start a session by calling the Smart-ID server RP API with a challenge when the user wishes to authenticate with the relying party’s service or create a signature. Either the user must scan a QR code for multi-device use case to launch the Smart-ID application or click a link for single-device use case to launch the Smart-ID application, or the Smart-ID server must send a push message notification to the user’s device where the user opens the Smart-ID application. The user checks the details of the transaction and enters a PIN code to confirm it. The application communicates with the Smart-ID server and once the final signature is created makes it available for the relying party to be fetched. Meanwhile, the relying party has been waiting for a reply from the Smart-ID server using a long poll connection. In case of success it receives the signature and the user’s certificate to be able to validate the result. The service creates digital signatures as proof of authentication and signing. However, to create electronic signatures the relying party must create the required document structure, calculate the hash and have that signed using this API. The latest version of the API introduces new flows collectively referred to as \"dynamic flows\". for multi-device use cases — dynamic QR codes that the user must scan; for single-device use cases where the user is visiting an RP webpage using a mobile browser — dynamic links which the user must click; for single-device use cases where the user is using an RP app — dynamic links which the user must click. The guiding principle in designing the API has been to unify those three aforementioned flows as much as possible to minimize the integration efforts for the RPs. Because of this, they share the same security mechanisms and principles, even though the medium of transmitting information is completely different. This also means that it is possible for an RP to offer alternative methods of authentication at the same time without doing multiple requests to RP-API. In RP API version 3, the notification based flows will still be available, but for maximum security, it is recommended that they are used only if the user has been authenticated at least once before in that device by one of the more secure dynamic flows. The recommended way for ensuring this is for the RP to utilize the client’s local storage (e.g. browser cookies) to keep track which clients have previously authenticated using the more secure flows. For both usability and security reasons, in the single-device use case the new dynamic links based flows should always be used. Brokers of the Smart-ID service are treated similarly to relying parties and there is no extra configuration compared to previous RP API versions. The following sequence diagram gives an overview of the new (more secure) dynamic link based authentication flow.

RP backend makes a request to RP-API to create a dynamic link based authentication or signature session, obtaining security parameters that are necessary for generating dynamic links. This request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous. RP starts dynamically creating dynamic links that update each second. The dynamic links are generated in RP backend and forwarded to RP frontend. RP frontend displays the QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning a QR code (preferred option for QR codes); Using a native camera app to scan a QR code (not supported by all camera apps); Clicking on a Web2App link in an RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on an App2App link in an RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and freshness of the dynamic link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. Backend responds by creating a transaction and returning the transaction data. Signing protocol continues in the usual way (user enters the PIN code). After the signature has been given, the RP receives the success result via the session status endpoint. In the case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). The following diagram describes the dynamic link based flow for the authentication session. The flow for the signature session follows the same principles and has been omitted. When RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a new dynamic link based session, Smart-ID server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique random value that will be used to connect this login attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - base64-encoded random key value that should be kept in secret and should be shared only between the RP backend and RP API server. RP then starts calculating and showing the QR image, Web2App link, and/or App2App link dynamically (all those links must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second). The RP may offer multiple options (a QR image and a Web2App link) to the user at the same time. This is useful in the following situations: The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device. RP wants to offer to the user the choice to authenticate either on the same device (via a Web2App link) or on a separate device (via a dynamic QR code). RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC. The next table lists all the parameters and definitions used in the dynamic link generation. They are all explained in more detail below. Parameters used for dynamic link generation Parameter Formula version A pre-defined version value, currently 0.1. sessionToken Generated by RP API. sessionSecret Generated by RP API. dynamicLinkType 'QR' (for QR codes) | 'Web2App' (for Web2App links) | 'App2App' (for App2App links) sessionType 'auth' | 'sign' elapsedSeconds Seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. payload A concatenating of the following 3 values in string form, separated by periods: dynamicLinkType.sessionType.elapsedSeconds authCode Calculated using HMAC SHA 256 algorithm and represented in Base64URL encoding. lang An ISO 639-2 language code. It should match the language that the user was seeing in the RP UI previously. This only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. The parameter sessionType describes the session type: 'auth' - authentication session 'sign' - signature session The lang parameter defines the interface language for the HTTPS fallback page that will be shown to the user when there are technical problems regarding opening dynamic links (for example, if user’s browser is blocking Web2App links and needs to be configured to allow them or if Smart-ID app is not installed on the phone). It is recommended that for consistent user experience, RP provides here the same language that the user was already using in the RP UI. The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. Notice that authCode must be re-calculated every 1s. As the next step, RP calculates payload using string concatenation and then uses it in HMACSHA256 calculation (explained below): payload := dynamicLinkType.sessionType.elapsedSeconds authCode := HMACSHA256(sessionSecret, payload) The calculation of payload must be done in the RP backend. dynamicLinkType, sessionType and elapsedSeconds must all be generated in the RP backend and RP frontend must not be able to change these parameters. Details about formatting the payload and sessionSecret parameters as byte strings for HMACSHA256 calculation: payload should be converted into a byte string from its ASCII string representation; sessionSecret should be used in its binary representation (it is returned from RP API in Base64 encoding); In the QR / Web2App link / App2App link, the result of hash calculation (parameter authCode) must be formatted in Base64URL encoding. The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters should be accessible by which parties. RP-API server RP backend RP frontend/app version sessionId sessionToken sessionSecret elapsedSeconds dynamicLinkType sessionType authCode lang Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - MUST NOT know parameter The dynamic link for App2App and Web2App is a URL string: https://https://smart-id.com/dynamic-link/?version=…​&sessionToken=…​&dynamicLinkType=…​&sessionType=…​&elapsedSeconds=…​&lang=…​&authCode=…​ Example of a Web2App link: https://https://smart-id.com/dynamic-link/?version=0.1&sessionToken=kj4mIOLOa75zeNKabFA5f251&dynamicLinkType=Web2App&sessionType=auth&elapsedSeconds=2&lang=eng&authCode=R5oiivdJIhfjJLBCA3AzijU2p8oH45fBKpcN59oSXboo For all flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to not leak the sessionSecret parameter. Also, it is forbidden to generate values of authCode parameter ahead of time and forward them to the RP frontend/app. In the App2App and Web2App flow it will be possible for the RP to also attach a callback URI that the Smart-ID App can call at the end of the transaction. This will allow for seamless navigation between RP apps and RP websites in the single-device use case. Details for this functionality are being worked on. The callback URL will also be part of the payload and as such protected by the authCode parameter. The allowed callback domains might be whitelisted by the Smart-ID Service. QR message itself is defined as a URL string, just like App2App and Web2App links. The only difference is the dynamicLinkType parameter value. https://https://smart-id.com/dynamic-link/?version=…​&sessionToken=…​&dynamicLinkType=…​&sessionType=…​&elapsedSeconds=…​&lang=…​&authCode=…​ Example: https://https://smart-id.com/dynamic-link/?version=0.1&sessionToken=kj4mIOLOa75zeNKabFA5f251&dynamicLinkType=QR&sessionType=auth&elapsedSeconds=2&lang=eng&authCode=R5oiivdJIhfjJLBCA3AzijU2p8oH45fBKpcN59oSXboo Here parameter authCode is represented in Base64URL encoding. Parameter sessionToken is inserted into the QR message exactly as it was obtained from RP API. Example of a QR code: For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW should be used. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal size for QR code is ~10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, as the underlying message in the QR code is essentially public information. In the App2App flow, it is not necessary to generate the link every second. Instead, the RP app can request a fresh link on-the-fly from the RP backend when the user clicks on a button in the RP app and navigate to it. For cases when the app is not installed or some other problem occurs with opening a dynamic link, a fallback HTTPS webpage is opened with instructions on how to resolve the issue. The lang parameter in the link is used to by default show the same language as on the RP UI. The instructions cover the following scenarios: User is not on a mobile device where Smart-ID is installed and has been allowed by the RP to use a wrong type of dynamic link. Smart-ID App is not installed on the current device. Mobile browser does not support universal links / Android App links. Mobile OS settings disallow the link and user intervention is required.","title":"Dynamic link flows","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.3","name":"dynamic_link_flows","url":"/rp-api/3.0.3/dynamic_link_flows.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Dynamic link calculation","hash":"_dynamic_link_calculation","id":2},{"text":"Link","hash":"_link","id":3},{"text":"QR","hash":"_qr","id":4},{"text":"Dynamic link and QR presentation","hash":"_dynamic_link_and_qr_presentation","id":5},{"text":"Fallback page","hash":"_fallback_page","id":6}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"This document has not been updated for RP version 3. After the updates it will be restructured and integrated into the rest of the RP API documentation. Although ID-card, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID are all secure technologies for authentication and digital signing, e-service providers (Relying Parties, RPs) need to consider potential risks, which are associated with digital authentication solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users to understand the context of their actions and to protect them from possible attacks. For example, there might be a malicious phishing website controlled by attacker between user’s browser and the RP’s website. This document lists attacks that can be launched against RP’s website or RP’s app, when the RP is using ID-card, Mobile-ID or Smart-ID for authentication and digital signatures. Both user interface options (browser and app) are considered and when it is not specifically stated, attacks and proposed countermeasures are relevant for both cases. Effective security measures for mitigating attacks are described in the following sections. Some security conscious RPs have already deployed them. Others should also consider implementing and deploying these measures and defences to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Guidelines are written in affirmative and imperative mood, however, not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else, who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the relying party’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures. Relying Party (RP, e-service provider) Organisation developing and managing the website and providing some service to its users. The organisation may bear financial losses in case cybercriminals are successful with their attacks. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Mobile-ID or Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures. The website is integrated with the Mobile-ID RP API (https://github.com/SK-EID/MID) or the Smart-ID RP API (https://github.com/SK-EID/smart-id-documentation). App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Users Natural persons with registered Mobile-ID/Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. All feedback to this document and proposed security measures is much appreciated. Please send it to the e-mail address support@sk.ee on the Secure Implementation Guidance. This section describes common attacks, which have been tried in the past against RPs, against their users and against SK ID Solutions. Giving a brief overview of the attacks is necessary as it may be the case some RPs are not aware of some of the attacks and may erroneously think they are safe. Also, not all countermeasures are effective against every possible attack. RPs will need to consider, which attacks could have the most devastating impact on their business and therefore, which countermeasures should be deployed first. Attacks are described in a generic way and don’t differentiate between browser, app, ID-cards, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID. User starts the login process on the RP’s website or app. They enter national identity code, but sometimes make a small error in the code. By random chance the entered incorrect code corresponds to another real person, who also has a Smart-ID or Mobile-ID account. Smart-ID/Mobile-ID system initiates the authentication transaction for the wrong user and the phone of another user wakes up and displays the authentication consent screen. It has occurred in the past the other user accepted the foreign consent dialog without verifying it and without having second thoughts confirmed it by entering PIN1, behaving almost like on auto-pilot. The session of the original user was then authenticated by the RP’s website, although the original user is logged into the wrong person’s account. There was no malicious attempt in the beginning, it was purely accidental error by both users. In this case, an attacker is specifically targeting some particular user. The attacker tries to irritate and to annoy the user by repeatedly initiating an authentication session with the user’s identity. This sends nefarious Smart-ID/Mobile-ID notifications to the user’s phone and disturbs normal phone usage. Attacker could ask for a ransom to cease the attack or simply cause inconvenience as a revenge. In a more advanced situation, an attacker targets the RP itself and starts many authentication sessions with the app or website of RP, using some scripted and automated tools. The attacker could use random usernames and generated national identity codes and this results nefarious notifications on phones of multiple users and disturbs normal phone usage. Not only does this cause inconvenience to users, but also, this kind of attack could result in a large number of complaints to SK ID Solutions and SK could be forced to temporarily cut off the Smart-ID and/or Mobile-ID service to the RP. This results in the outage of the RP’s website or app, because other users cannot login either. Attacker could ask for a ransom to cease the attack or simply cause damage as a revenge. An advanced version of this attack targets multiple RP’s and in such a widespread attack, SK could be forced to temporarily cut off the Smart-ID and/or Mobile-ID service to those RPs, who are not able to filter the malicious authentication attempts by themselves. An attacker is trying to extract and deduce information about Mobile-ID/Smart-ID users through the RP’s website or other information systems or software. For example, the attacker initiates a Smart-ID authentication session on the RP’s website with a generated national identity code. If no error message is returned, the attacker can deduce that this particular user has a Smart-ID account and it may be worthwhile to try some further attacks against that particular user. In more advanced situation, the attacker may be able to use the RP’s information system to download the user’s signing certificate. Phishing attacks are intended to confuse users and to gain access to the RP’s e-service under the user’s name. Usually, these attacks are automated and distributed in large quantities via spam e-mails. The attacker hopes some percentage of users, who are not aware of risks and are not careful, will \"take the bait\" and be \"hooked\". Hence, the name \"phishing\" (fishing). However, e-mail and browsers are not the only attack vector. In case the RP requires digital signatures in order to commit an operation or transaction on the e-service, the attacker tries to further confuse the user and will try to get the user to enter PIN2 for the signing request as well. Previously, phishing has been attempted in a manual (non-automated) ways and with simple (static) counterfeit websites. However, with advances in attack tools, more powerful attackers must be considered. Nowadays, they are able to build authentic looking and well-functioning dynamic websites, which proxy authentic HTML pages and images from the original website of the RP. General steps of such kind of phishing attacks are following: An attacker sends users a phishing e-mail with a URL to the proxy website and waits until the user connects to the attacker’s website. Automatic tools then connect from the proxy website to the original website of the RP. The user enters all the required information (username, national identity code, …​) and starts authenticating on the attacker’s website. The proxy website sends the same information to the original website and starts the same kind of authentication session there as well and mediates back the correct Mobile-ID/Smart-ID verification code and any other displayed information. The user sees the authentication dialog on the mobile device, with correct serviceName, correct displayText and correct verification code. The user will consent to the authentication dialog and enters PIN1, although the attacker’s proxy will be logged in to the user’s account at the RP’s website. After logging in, the attacker’s proxy waits until the user initiates the operation or transaction and changes details of the transaction on the fly (for example, change the destination bank account number of the transfer order) and starts the changed transaction on the original website. The user enters the PIN2 to confirm the transaction, but it will be the attacker’s changed transaction that will be executed. An attacker makes a phone call to a user, posing as an employee of the RP (or some other authoritative person, for example, police officer) and persuades the user that they need to perform a Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication in order to confirm something fictional. General steps of such kind of phishing attacks are following: An attacker gathers the required information (username, national identity code, …​) from the user or has already them at hand before the phone call. The attacker navigates with the browser to the RP’s original website and starts the authentication session under the name of the user. Website initiates the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication and displays the verification code to the attacker. (Instead of the website, the attacker could use the RP’s app as well.) The attacker informs the user that Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication needs to be performed and tells them the verification code and asks to complete the authentication on the mobile device. The user verifies the authentication dialog on the device, consents and enters PIN1. The Browser of the attacker is logged into the RP’s website under the user’s identity. The attacker starts an operation (for example, a transfer order) on the RP’s website. The website initiates the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID digital signature operation and displays the verification code to the attacker. The attacker informs the user, still on the phone call, that Mobile-ID/Smart-ID digital signature needs to be created as well, and tells them the verification code and asks to complete the signing operation on the mobile device. The user verifies the digital signature dialog on the mobile device, consents and enters PIN2. The operation on the website of the RP is executed. This section lists security measures, which can be deployed by the RP itself in order to protect from threats and attacks listed in the previous section. This table describes proposed security measures. It includes the following information: In case the proposed security measure is considered mandatory for customers of SK ID Solutions, it is marked as \"MUST\". In case it is recommended, it is marked as \"SHOULD\". Information whether the security measure can be applied to websites and/or apps. Most of the measures are universal, but there are specific measures, such as \"keeping track of trusted browsers\" that apply only in certain situations. Information whether the security measure can be applied in case of ID-card, Mobile-ID and/or Smart-ID integration.

RP must implement the following checks and controls. Using simple means just to include a number of CA certificates in the TLS server configuation is not enough. SK ID Solutions uses many CAs and TLS server needs information about them all in order to build trust chains. However, not all of the CAs are used to issue ID-card certificates and this information needs to be manually added. It is important to explicitly specify, which CA-s are trusted to issue the certificates for the CCA authentication and which CAs are not trusted to do that. For example the OpenSSL utility can be used for that: cd /path/to/trusted_certificates_directory/ wget https://c.sk.ee/EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt wget https://www.sk.ee/upload/files/EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt wget https://c.sk.ee/esteid2018.pem.crt ... openssl x509 -addreject clientAuth -trustout -in EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt -out EE-GovCA2018_trusted.pem.crt openssl x509 -addreject clientAuth -trustout -in EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt -out EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA_trusted.pem.crt openssl x509 -addtrust clientAuth -trustout -in esteid2018.pem.crt -out esteid2018_trusted.pem.crt ... rm EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt rm EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt rm esteid2018.pem.crt Note that it is important to include the certificate of root CAs and implicitly configure clientAuth reject for them. When configuring Apache in this way, it is also neccessary to use the SSLCADNRequestPath directive, which specifies the list of acceptable CA-s, which are sent to the client over the TLS handshake. cd /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ wget https://c.sk.ee/esteid2018.pem.crt openssl rehash /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ After specifying trust settings for individual certificates, allow TLS server to only trust these CAs and to request specific certificates from clients (configuration example is given for Apache mod_ssl): #... SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile ... SSLCertificateKeyFile ... SSLCACertificatePath /path/to/trusted_certificates_directory/ SSLCADNRequestPath /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ #... Web-eID provides authentication using a custom protocol instead of TLS CCA. When implementing it adhere to the requirements and configuration outlined in the documentation. Web-eID validation libraries handle correct verification of ID-card certificates on your behalf. Keeping the Web-eID software libraries updated is critical. https://web-eid.eu/ SK Identity Solutions provides OCSP service to check for the validity of issued certificates. More details are available at https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en/services/validity-confirmation-services/ Configuration example is given for Apache mod_ssl: #... SSLEngine on SSLOCSPEnable leaf SSLOCSPDefaultResponder \"http://responder.example.com:8888/responder\" SSLOCSPOverrideResponder on #... It is important to only accept these certificates, which correspond to production ID-cards, Digi-ID and other identity documents. An attacker could present other certificates as well and in some cases this might lead to a vulnerability. Issuance policy is recorded in the certificate extension X509v3 Certificate Policies and contains an OID identifier. Identifier values of issuance policies are listed at the page https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en/repository/CP/ and https://www.skidsolutions.eu/upload/files/SK-CPR-ESTEID2018-EN-v1_2_20200630.pdf. Following table compiles a helpful list of policies relevant to accept in the TLS-CCA authentication sessions.

RP would need to export the full client certificate from the TLS session to the application server and then apply filtering with PHP or other applications. Configuration example with Apache mod_ssl: #... SSLEngine on #... SSLOptions +ExportCertData #... and source code example with PHP: $cert = getenv('SSL_CLIENT_CERT'); $x509 = openssl_x509_parse($cert); $certificatePolicies = 'Policy: 1.3.6.1.4.1.51361.1.1.1'; if(preg_match(\"/$certificatePolicies$/m\", $x509['extensions']['certificatePolicies']) == 0) { echo \"OK\\n\"; } Note that demo code examples only use a single OID value. Production systems would have to use the whole table. It is important to only accept these certificates, which have the \"TLS Web Client Authentication\" extension and are issued by trusted CAs. Partial configuration example for Apache: #... <Location \"/\"> Require expr \"TLS Web Client Authentication, E-mail Protection\" in PeerExtList('extendedKeyUsage') </Location> #... and partial configuration example for F5 BIG-IP loadbalancer: when CLIENTSSL_CLIENTCERT { HTTP::release if { [SSL::cert count] < 1 } { reject } set client_cert [SSL::cert 0] set clientCA [X509::cert_fields $client_cert [SSL::verify_result] issuer ] #If issuer contains \"-SK 20\" assume it is a SK certificate and process further if {($clientCA contains \"-SK 20\") } { if {($clientCA contains \"ESTEID-SK 20\") } { #If issued by ESTEID check if it is mobile-id or not, mobile-ID profile doesn't have TLS web auth enabled if { !([X509::extensions $client_cert] contains \"TLS Web Client Authentication\") } { log local0. \"Invalid certificate used for authentication, IP: [IP::client_addr], Issued by: $clientCA\" reject } } else { #Not issued by ESTEID, shouldn't allow TLS auth log local0. \"Invalid certificate used for authentication, IP: [IP::client_addr], Issued by: $clientCA\" reject } } } serviceName is a short text string, displayed to the user in the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent dialog. It helps user to verify that the request is coming from a trusted source. serviceName will be displayed on the top of the consent screen, in bold letters. SK ID Solutions have established basic requirements that serviceName should contain one of the following: name of the company, a DNS domain which your website is using, a registered trademark, associated with the website or app, which the user is interacting with, a brand name, associated with the website or app, which the user is interacting with. Generic serviceName, which does not help user to distinguish between different RP-s, are not accepted (such as \"login\", \"authentication\", etc). displayText is a short text string, displayed to the user in the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent dialog. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen, under the verification code number. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Mobile-ID or Smart-ID to authenticate users, who are calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence, that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent, who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. With signing operations, there’s also possibility to use much longer and descriptive displayText. For more details, see section Defence: show details of transactions in the displayText. At the basic security level, Smart-ID is using a 4-digit verification code, which is displayed to a user on the RP’s website and on the Smart-ID app. The user is expected to match these and thus verify they consent to the correct authentication or signature request. At more advanced security level, the RP can request the Smart-ID app should display three verification codes (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code, which is displayed by the RP’s website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the verificationCodeChoice interaction type. More information in the API documentation: https://github.com/SK-EID/smart-id-documentation/tree/v2 In case the RP is using an app it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP-API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app, before the screen of the Smart-ID app is displayed. In order to increase trust and confidence in users, it is useful to show details of the last successful session. The RP must prominently display the information about the last authentication, including such elements: Date and time of the last successful authentication. Geographic location (country) of the last successful authentication. Short human readable description of the browser last used for successful authentication (such as \"Chrome on Windows\", \"Safari on Mac\"), deduced from the browser’s user-Agent header. This will help users to recognise the last login details and increase their confidence that nobody else has accessed their account after their last login. If they don’t recognise the last session, the user can contact the RP’s user support and raise the alarm. With password-based authentication systems, it was a good practice (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#authentication-responses) to show same error message for two cases: username was incorrect and the account didn’t exist, and username was correct, but the password was incorrect. This helps to prevent the user account enumeration (WSTG-IDNT-04). With Mobile-ID and Smart-ID services, following the same principle helps to prevent data mining for attack preparation. It also makes some phishing attacks more difficult. Mobile-ID RP API and Smart-ID RP API return different error codes to help debuging: Mobile-ID RP API, HTTP 200, \"result\": \"NOT_MID_CLIENT\" — \"Given user has no active certificates and is not MID client\" Smart-ID RP API, HTTP 404 — \"object described in URL was not found, essentially meaning that the user does not have an account in Smart-ID system\" Smart-ID RP API, HTTP 471 — \"No suitable account of requested type found, but user has some other accounts\" However, it is the reponsibility of the RP not to show different UI messages for those cases, but to follow generic, uniform pattern: Request new authentication session from the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID API with the user identifier. In case the API responded with the new authentication session: Display the text \"Authentication session started, verification code 1234\" with the value of the verification code given by Mobile-ID or Smart-ID API In case the authentication is successful, continue with the login In case the authentication session is timed out after 120 seconds, show the error message \"User account not found or user didn’t responded in time\" In case the API responded with \"NOT_MID_CLIENT\" or \"HTTP 404\" or \"HTTP 471\": Generate random verification code value Display the text \"Authentication session started, verification code 1234\" Wait for 120 seconds and then show the error message \"User account not found or user didn’t responded in time\" Good design of the website should include a way for a user to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on the user’s account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognise and that could point to security incidents. On the other hand, when the user does recognise all the history, it will increase the trust in the website and services of the RP. Also, the RP must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. displayText is a short text string, displayed to a user in the Smart-ID signing consent dialog that helps the user understand the context of the operation. There are two options for the string length of the displayText: short displayText string can be up to 60 characters and it will be displayed as a single line below the verification code, on the same screen as the keypad for entering PIN2. longer displayText string can be up to 200 characters and it will be displayed on a separate screen to gain the user’s attention. In case there’s an advanced phishing attack in progress and an attacker is presenting a modified website to the user, with the modified operation details, such as destination account number of the transfer order, the user cannot detect the attack solely with the user’s browser. However, the string of the displayText is coming directly from the RP and the attacker cannot modify it to deceive the user. This way, the RP can use a secondary authentic channel to allow the user to verify and confirm the operation. A common way to start the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID authentication is to ask for a user identifier, either the phone number or national identity number. However, these numbers are not secret and even though they are not outright published, there are ways for an attacker to obtain the national identity number of the user and start authenticating on their behalf. It is also possible for the attacker to create automated scripts to simply generate a list of numbers and try them all to start many authentication sessions under the name of multiple users. A better approach is to ask for an additional identifier. With Mobile-ID, a good option is to ask for both phone number and national identity number. The Mobile-ID API verifies that those identifiers match with each other and doesn’t initiate the authentication session otherwise. With Smart-ID, a good option is to ask for national identity number and some not-so-public identifier as well. It could be a username, which the users can select by themselves, the account contract number or something else only the user knows and is convenient for them to remember and type. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whether the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to login from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. The tracking should be done with the HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage feature supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier. The status of each browser instance for the user is then tracked in the RP’s website database. The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The browser cookie has to be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags. The scope of the cookie has to be the URL of the RP’s website. In case of a phishing attack, the proxied website will be setup on a different URL and the browser will not send the value of that cookie to the attacker’s website. Therefore, the attacker cannot pose to the RP’s website as the trusted browser. In order to manage the data associated with the tracking, each user account must have the following extra data for each browser which the user has connected from in the past: displayName — Human recognisable description of the browser, like \"Chrome on Windows\" or \"Safari on my work Mac\", etc. Simple names with tolerable errors could be generated automatically from the browser’s User-Agent header with the help of software libraries and toolkits. The RP could also allow the user to edit this field, so that the user can provide their own meaningful names. lastSeen — Timestamp, when that browser was last used by the user to connect to the RP’s website. hashedTrackingID — Hashed value of the randomly generated identifier. Length of the identifier should be at least 32 bytes. The Base64 encoded clear-text value of the identifier is placed in the browser’s cookie and the hashed value is stored in the database. Storing only hashed values makes the database leak less dangerous. Salting hashes, a common practice when when storing passwords, is not required, because trackingID is already long enough with random bytes and additional protection against brute-forcing is not essential. trustLevel — Information about whether that browser instance could be considered trusted or not. Proposed algorithm uses values \"seenOnce\", \"seenTwice\" and \"trusted\". The RP could use more levels if required. Note that in case multiple users are using the same browser instance then the same hashedTrackingID value will be stored for multiple user accounts. Care must be taken to lookup the correct record, based on the user account, which is starting the authentication. A general algorithm to keep track of the browsers and to manage the trustLevel is described below. When the user navigates with the browser to the RP’s website and requests the Smart-ID authentication, the following cases are possible: If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is not known (i.e. the browser didn’t send the cookie value or the cookie value doesn’t match any value of hashedTrackingID in the user’s account) and the user doesn’t have any other browser’s trustLevel as \"trusted\", proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, the RP should update the browser’s trustLevel as \"seenOnce\". If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is not known and the user already has at least one other browser as \"trusted\", then the situation indicates a possible phishing attack. The RP should perform additional checks and controls. If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"trusted\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication. The situation indicates somewhat lower risk and the RP could decide not to execute some security measures, which are required otherwise, for example, asking the user to enter multiple identifiers. After successful authentication, the RP should update the lastSeen timestamp. If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"seenOnce\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, if the lastSeen timestamp was older than 24 hours, the browser’s trustLevel will be updated as \"seenTwice\". If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"seenTwice\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, if the lastSeen timestamp was older than 24 hours, the browser’s trustLevel will be set as \"trusted\". The described algorithm can be implemented and silently deployed by the RP without any additional security measures or checks actually performed in the first phase. Those browsers, which are regularly used by users, will eventually move to the \"trusted\" classification. In the next phase, additional security measures could be put into place and when the new connection is being made from an unknown browser, additional security measures will kick in and protect users. The following sections describe such additional security measures. When the RP detects that a user has started authenticating from a known browser, the RP could withhold the requirement to ask for multiple user identifiers. Good simplification is to only require one identifier, such as the username of the user. After the username is entered on the RP’s website, the RP can lookup the user’s account information from the internal database and then initiate the Smart-ID authentication with the national identity number. However, when the RP detects the user has started an authentication session from an unknown browser, while he usually connects to the website from a different browser, the RP can ask for additional details from the user, to verify that it is indeed the user who is starting the authentication. Such details could be to the national identity number or something else, which the user knows, but the attacker might not know. When the RP detects that a user has started authentication from an unknown browser, while he usually connects to the website from a different browser, the RP can use the longer displayText and send an alert to the user. The alert would be sent in the same authentication session request as usual, but it will be displayed on a separate screen to the user during the authentication consent dialog. The RP could use a message, such as: \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\", or \"It seems that you are not using your regular browser. Are you using a new computer and are you sure that you are on the correct website www.example-rp.com?\" or something similar. The message will be displayed on a separate screen from the usual PIN1 entry dialog and the user will be asked to either confirm or cancel. In case the user is really connecting from a new computer and is aware of this, they can press \"Confirm\". The authentication then proceeds, the user can enter PIN1 and the user’s browser will be logged in to the user’s account. However, if this comes to the user as a surprise and the user is actually using their regular computer, the user can press \"Cancel\" and investigate further. When a user connects to the RP’s e-service, either with a browser or with the RP’s app, it connects from the IP-address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection by itself or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s IP-address. There are commercial services, which provide the general information about IP-addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP-address is known to be used for the following: Sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP-address might be using a compromised computer. Is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP-address might be using a compromised computer or that the attacker is using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website. Is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymising VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website. Is known to be an IP-address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network. This may indicate that the requests coming from such IP-addresses are used to perform denial of service or data mining attack. In addition to such commercial services, the RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP-addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. The following sections describe possible actions to take when there’s suspicion of an attack. RP can use the longer displayText and send an alert to the user. RP could use a message text, such as \"Authentication started from an IP-address with open proxy service. Are you sure that you are on the correct website www.example-rp.com?\", or something similar. The message will be displayed on a separate screen from the usual PIN1 entry and the user will be asked to either confirm or cancel. There could be legitimate reasons why the user is using such IP-address or VPN service and if the user is aware of this, they can press \"Confirm\". However, if this comes to the user as a surprise, the user can press \"Cancel\" and investigate further. In case the source IP-address is used to send many authentication requests and there’s suspicion that a denial of service attack is in progress, RP can perform additional verification on the browser with a CAPTCHA. This can slow down the attackers and forces them to change their scripts and tactics. In case the source IP-address is associated with a previous fraud case and is known to be malicious, the RP can block this connection and deny service. The RP must first record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP-address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to the list of suspicious IP-addresses or malicious IP-addresses; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. When it is known that the RP responds quickly to attacks and attackers are caught by the law enforcement it also acts as a deterrent to future attackers. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organisations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP-addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. For using cookies a cookie consent must be asked from the data subject and the information about using such cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Secure Implementation Guide","component":"rp-api","version":"3.0.3","name":"secure","url":"/rp-api/3.0.3/secure.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The first three are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fourth is a GET used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The authentication session is used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the signature session is used to create digital signature; the certificatechoice session is used immediately prior to the signature session when the user’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; finally, the session status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. Their implementation details are described in their respective subpages. There are two types of flows that can be used for authentication and signature sessions - the notification based flow and the dynamic link based flow. The certificatechoice session can only be used with notification based flow. There are different ways to reference users - via their issued identifier, a document number linking a specific account or even not at all (in case of dynamic link based flows). The different object references are described on a dedicated page. The main use cases and which sessions and flows to use are described below. Utilizing the RP API as described below provides the best user experience and security. In the URL examples below and other pages BASE refers to the RP API base address https://https://rp-api.smart-id.com Use case: The RP session is on a separate device from the mobile phone where the Smart-ID app is installed. For example, the user is using a PC browser to access an RP website or a tablet to access an RP application. Using the dynamic link based flow with QR codes is the most secure: RP calls the anonymous dynamic link based authentication session endpoint and displays a QR code that the user must scan with the Smart-ID app. BASE/v3/authentication/dynamic-link/anonymous Instead of using the anonymous authentication session endpoint, the RP can request the user to enter their user identifier and utilize the non-anonymous authentication session endpoint. This may be beneficial when the RP utilizes custom usernames. BASE/v3/authentication/dynamic-link/etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural Notification based authentication session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a dynamic link based flow beforehand. It is up to RP to decide how to identify such devices/browsers (e.g. by setting up a unique device identifier and storing it in the browser’s cookies). Using a notification based authentication session endpoint triggers a push notification to all the user’s devices instead of the user having to scan QR codes. BASE/v3/authentication/notification/etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural If a user has already logged onto the RP app or website using Smart-ID authentication, the RP can call the notification based signature session endpoint to sign using the same Smart-ID account that was used for authentication. In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a dynamic link based flow beforehand. It is up to RP to decide how to identify such devices/browsers (e.g. by setting up a unique device identifier and storing it in the device). The document number is attained from the preceding authentication call. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/:documentnumber In many cases, the user’s signing certificate is required before the signature session can be initiated. Calling the notification based certificatechoice session endpoint allows obtaining it. As the document number is already known, no user interaction is required for the certificatechoice session and the RP API can immediately provide the certificate. BASE/v3/certificatechoice/notification/document/:documentnumber Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP should call the notification based signature session endpoint. The Smart-ID app will wait for the signature session and return only after it has been completed. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/:documentnumber In case no prior authentication has taken place, the dynamic link based signature session endpoint should be called. BASE/v3/signature/dynamic-link/etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural Often though the certificate is required prior to the signing request. For this, RP should first call the notification based certificatechoice session endpoint. BASE/v3/certificatechoice/notification/etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP should call the notification based signature session endpoint. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/:documentnumber Use case: The RP frontend (whether an RP app or website accessed by a mobile browser) resides on the same mobile device as the Smart-ID app. The client is using a mobile app or RP detects that the user is on a mobile browser so it can be assumed that the user intends to use the Smart-ID app on the same device. However, a fallback option should also be provided to switch to the separate device use case. Use the anonymous dynamic link based authentication session endpoint for App2App and Web2App flows. BASE/v3/authentication/dynamic-link/anonymous Alternatively, the non-anonymous flow can be used to too. BASE/v3/authentication/dynamic-link/etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural As a fallback (in case the Smart-ID app is on a separate account), RP should provide an option to use QR codes instead of the App2App or Web2App link. There is no need to query the RP API again for this. Call the dynamic link based signature session endpoint and provide the document number from the authentication session to ensure the same account is being used. BASE/v3/signature/dynamic-link/document/:documentnumber As the document number is already known, no user interaction is required for the certificatechoice session and the RP API can immediately provide the certificate. In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a dynamic link based flow. Setting up a unique device identifier is left to the RP to implement.

The signature protocol ACSP_V1 is used for authentication requests and RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol for signing. Authentication Context Signature Protocol version 1 makes the signature non-replayable by adding a server-side component to the signed object. The RP must provide the digest algorithm to use as well a challenge it needs signed. The challenge must be generated anew for every single authentication request. It must be remembered by the RP for the duration of the authentication session, and later it is used to reconstruct and validate the signed authentication data structure. The recommended way of generating the challenge this is to use the Java SecureRandom class[1] or equivalent method in other programming languages, to generate a random value for each new authentication request. The value of the randomChallenge must be kept in the current user’s session on the backend for later use in response validation. Signature protocol parameters for authentication request with signature protocol ACSP_V1 Parameter Type Mandatory Description randomChallenge string + A random value which is calculated by generating random bits with size in the range of 32 bytes …​ 64 bytes and applying Base64 encoding (according to rfc4648). It is generated per each authentication session in the RP backend. See above for details. signatureAlgorithm string + Digital signature algorithm name. See here for supported signature algorithms. The following table describes the signature body for ACSP_V1 protocol that the RP will receive in the session response. Notice that the actual object that was signed is not present — it needs to be compiled by the RP using the previously sent randomChallenge and the serverRandom returned in this response. This re-constructed object is then used to validate the signature. Signature body for ACSP_V1 in session response Parameter Type Mandatory Description value string + Signature value, base64 encoded. serverRandom string + A random value of 24 or more characters from Base64 alphabet, which is generated at RP API service side. RP must validate that the value contains only valid Base64 characters, and that the length is not less than 24 characters. This value will be returned from RP API and RelyingParties must use it exactly as it was returned during the validation of signature. There are not any guarantees that the returned value length is the same in each call of the RP API. signatureAlgorithm string + Digital signature algorithm name. This is a reference name to algorithm defined in some Public-Key cryptography standards. See here for supported signature algorithms. ACSP_V1 signature sample { \"signatureProtocol\": \"ACSP_V1\", \"signature\": { \"value\": \"B+A9CfjIBZnDHHav3B4F...\", \"serverRandom\": \"B+C9XVjIAZnCHH9vfBSv...\", \"signatureAlgorithm\": \"sha512WithRSAEncryption\" } } To verify the signature.value the RP client must reconstruct its input digest (hash) and calculate it themselves. The digest is calculated over the concatenation of the signatureProtocol, the Base64 encoded serverRandom and the Base64 encoded randomChallenge separated by semicolons: digest(signatureProtocol + \";\" + serverRandom + \";\" + randomChallenge) Note that signature.serverRandom in the response and the randomChallenge in the initial request are already Base64 encoded. The signature algorithm that was used to generate the signature based on the digest is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm. Full verification of the signature and response is described in Response verification. The RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol allows direct signing of the digest that is requested by the RP. The RP must provide the digest algorithm to use as well the digest hash that is being signed. In case an electronic signature is being created this is calculated from the electronic signature container.

All messages are encoded using UTF-8. All requests only support HTTP/1.1, as described in RFC 2616. Normally, all positive responses are returned with HTTP status code 200. In some cases, 400 series error codes are used, those cases are described per request. All 500 series error codes indicate some kind of fatal server error. Whenever an RP session creation request (POST to signature/certificate-choice/ or signature/) is repeated inside a 15 second timeframe with exactly the same parameters, session ID of an existing session can be returned as a result. This allows to retry RP POST requests in case of communication errors. When the caller wants, it can override the idempotent behaviour inside this timeframe using an optional nonce parameter present for signature/certificate-choice and signature POST requests. Normally, that parameter can be omitted. IMPORTANT Providing nonce parameter is not allowed for authentication requests, since each authentication request must provide a randomly generated value for rpChallenge, making each authentication request already unique. RP API clients are authenticated based on their originating IP-address and relyingPartyUUID protocol parameter combinations. When authentication fails, server responds with HTTP error 401. relyingPartyName request field is case-insensitive and must match one of the names configured for the calling RP. The names are UTF-8 encoded and are displayed to the user in the Smart-ID application. The Smart-ID service reserves the right to add new fields into responses of the current RP API version. Therefore, the RP must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response objects at any location within the JSON structure. It is essential that RP client performs all the required checks when connecting to the Smart-ID RP API HTTPS endpoint, to make sure that the connection endpoint is authentic and that the connection is secure. This is required to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for the authentication and signature protocols. The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS ciphersuite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint is valid (not expired, signed by trusted CA and not revoked). In case the RP fails to verify the connection is genuine and secure an attacker might be able to launch an MITM attack on the connection and either login as the user or have the user sign a forged document.

Used as the key in authCode calculation. Must be base64 decoded before use. schemeName Scheme name is defined by Smart-ID service and it ties the link to the Smart-ID context. Only allowed value is: smart-id signatureProtocol Allowed values: ACSP_V2 - for authentication session, RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signature session, empty - for certificate-choice session. rpChallenge rpChallenge used in the initial authentication request. For more details, see ACSP_V2 signature request parameters. digest digest used in the initial signature request. For more details, see RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters. relyingPartyName relyingPartyName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. brokeredRpName brokeredRpName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. This is only used by those RPs that act as a broker for other RPs. Otherwise must be empty. interactions interactions used in the initial authentication or signature request in Base64 encoded form. Empty for certificate-choice session request. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be reused here in order to guarantee that the values match exactly. initialCallbackUrl Callback URL the Smart-ID app will add parameters to and launch after a successful signature has been given (only in Web2App and App2App flows). Must use HTTPS scheme. unprotectedDeviceLink The final URL without the authCode field. Including this in authCode calculation ensures that the link itself can’t be changed by any malicious party. RP API returns sessionSecret in Base64 encoded form. The Base64 string value must be decoded into a byte array before use: sessionSecret := BASE64-DECODE(sessionSecret) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.util.Base64; public class Base64Decode { public static void main(String[] args) { String sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; byte[] sessionSecretBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode( sessionSecretBase64 ); } } <?php $sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; $sessionSecret = base64_decode($sessionSecretBase64); ?> import base64 session_secret_base64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" session_secret_bytes = base64.b64decode(session_secret_base64) package main import ( \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var sessionSecretBase64 string = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" var sessionSecretBytes, err = base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(sessionSecretBase64) if err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Printf(\"%q\\n\", sessionSecretBytes) } use base64::Engine as _; fn main() { let session_secret_base64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; let session_secret_bytes: &[u8] = &base64::engine::general_purpose::STANDARD.decode(session_secret_base64).unwrap(); } import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val sessionSecretBase64: String = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" val sessionSecretBytes: ByteArray = Base64.getDecoder().decode(sessionSecretBase64) } using System; public class Base64Decode { public static void Main(string[] args) { string sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; byte[] sessionSecretBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(sessionSecretBase64); } } const sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; const sessionSecret = Buffer.from(sessionSecretBase64, 'base64'); require 'base64' session_secret_base64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" session_secret = Base64.decode64(session_secret_base64) Example 10. sessionSecret parameter B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps= Scheme name that ties the link to the Smart-ID context.

For Web2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP website. RP website backend has to set a session cookie to the user’s browser. This cookie must be set as SameSite=Lax because later, the Smart-ID app will launch the callback URL using top-level navigation and the request type will be GET. RP website backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP website backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL address of RP website and their browser will have the same session cookie. Some aspects to take into account are: User will end up on a new browser tab; The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP website sends the callback URL to RP website backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP website backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session cookie matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. In cases where user initiated the authentication/signing flow on a mobile browser that was not their default browser, the HTTPS callback URL will probably be opened in the default browser which will not have the session cookie and thus the verification must fail. The protocol steps for handling App2App callback URLs are functionally the same as for Web2App; however, there are also some differences in the steps below due to fundamental differences between webpages and apps. For App2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP app. RP app has to save a session identifier in the app’s storage. RP app backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session identifier. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP app backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL, which will cause RP app to open (for this to work, RP app has to be configured to handle that domain and path of the URL). The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP app sends the callback URL together with the session identifier from storage to RP app backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP app backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session identifier matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. If the initial callback URL provided by RP backend is: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ then in the authentication flow the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=TIRImorSPPxBbNSJhTSPpY4GYM3ZXdHkXj2LFVUL2QI&userChallengeVerifier=XtPfaGa8JnGtYrJjboooUf0KfY9sMEHrWFpSQrsUv9c In the signature and certificate-choice flows the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=TIRImorSPPxBbNSJhTSPpY4GYM3ZXdHkXj2LFVUL2QI For both Web2App and App2App callback URLs, the checks described above provide complete phishing resistance.

It consists of the following steps: User interacts with an RP frontend (a webpage or an app). RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a device link based session (authentication, signature, or certificate-choice) to obtain security parameters that are necessary for generating device links. For authentication and certificate-choice sessions, the request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous (signature session can’t be anonymous). RP starts creating device links. In case of QR codes, but not Web2App nor App2App links, the links must be updated each second. The device links must be generated in the RP backend and then forwarded to the RP frontend each time. RP frontend displays QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning the dynamic QR code (preferred option for QR codes); Using a native camera app to scan the dynamic QR code (not supported by all camera apps) which opens the Smart-ID app where user has to scan the QR code again. Clicking on the Web2App link in an RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on the App2App link in an RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and freshness of the device link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. The user is asked to verify the transaction details and enter their PIN. After the signature has been given, the RP receives the result via the session status endpoint. In case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). User is redirected back to the RP with the given callback URL in same-device flows and RP performs the callback URL verification steps described in Callback URLs page. IMPORTANT For device link flows, a single request must be sent. For a single session that displays both a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, multiple requests must not be sent. Some examples: If an RP would like to display a Web2App or App2App link without a dynamic QR code, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started. If an RP would like to display a dynamic QR code without the option for Web2App or App2App links, a device link flow can be started without a callback URL. If an RP would like to display both, a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started (but the callback URL will only be relevant if the user interacts with the Web2App/App2App link, not the QR code). In same-device flow, it may be easier for RP to send a request to session status endpoint only after the callback has been received. This is only relevant when the QR code flow is not provided. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the authentication session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the signature session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the certificateChoice session. When RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a new device link based session, RP-API server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique value that is used to connect this authentication/signing attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - Base64 encoded key value that must be kept secret and must not be shared with any other party (including RP frontend); deviceLinkBase - the base URL to be used to generate the QR/Web2App/App2App device links. RP then calculates the Web2App or App2App device link and dynamic QR code and shows it to the end user. The dynamic QR code must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second. It is recommended that RP offers multiple options, QR image and Web2App link, to the user at the same time if either: RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC, The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device, and might want to authenticate using a separate mobile device. NOTE The device link structure is similar for both same-device and cross-device flows. The differences between them are: The value of deviceLinkType is different (Web2App, App2App vs QR), same-device links do not have elapsedSeconds and should not be dynamically regenerated, the final representation of the link to the user is different (a clickable HTTPS link vs a dynamic QR code). IMPORTANT All values in the deviceLink are case-sensitive. The resulting deviceLink must match bit by bit with the expected deviceLink in the Smart-ID backend. There must not be URL encoding in the deviceLink. There must not be URL fragment (#) in the deviceLink. The order of the path parameters in the device link must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; in QR flows, callbackUrl must be included as an empty field; in same-device flows, elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink.

QR code (authentication session) For more details on how the dynamic QR code or other device links should be presented in the RP frontend, see Device link and QR presentation section. The table below explains the parameters that are included in the device link calculation. Parameter Formula version A pre-defined version value, currently 1.0. sessionToken Generated by RP API. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is. deviceLinkType Allowed values: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. sessionType Allowed values: auth - for authentication session, sign - signature session, cert - certificate-choice session. elapsedSeconds Seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. Only used in cross-device flows (dynamic QR code). lang An ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It should match the language that the user was seeing in the RP UI previously. This only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. authCode Calculated using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, using sessionSecret as the key, authCodePayload as the payload, and represented in Base64URL encoding. Explained in a separate page. IMPORTANT The calculation of device links must be performed in the RP backend. All values (including elapsedSeconds) must all be generated in the RP backend and the RP frontend must not be able to change or affect these parameters. For dynamic QR code flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to leak the sessionSecret parameter. Also, it is forbidden to generate values of authCode parameter ahead of time and forward them to the RP frontend/app. version parameter is a pre-defined value. Currently, only 1.0 is supported. It must be used in string form in device links. Example 6. version parameter \"1.0\" RP API returns sessionToken. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 7. sessionToken parameter \"tw1hOWNAcw0wd-e9OalXV-Sr\" The parameter deviceLinkType describes the device link type: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 8. deviceLinkType parameter \"QR\" The parameter sessionType describes the session type: auth - for authentication session, sign - for signature session, cert - for certificate-choice session. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 9. sessionType parameter \"auth\" The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial session creation request to RP API. Notice that dynamic QR code link must be re-calculated each second because the elapsedSeconds value changes. elapsedSeconds value must be converted to string value to be used in QR code links: elapsedSeconds := TO-STRING(elapsedSeconds) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby public class Int2Str { public static void main(String[] args) { int elapsedSeconds = 22; String elapsedSecondsStr = Integer.toString(elapsedSeconds); System.out.println(elapsedSecondsStr); } } <?php $elapsedSeconds = 22; $elapsedSecondsStr = strval($elapsedSeconds); echo $elapsedSecondsStr; ?> elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = str(elapsed_seconds) print(elapsed_seconds_str) package main import ( \"fmt\" \"strconv\" ) func main() { var elapsedSeconds int = 22 var elapsedSecondsStr string = strconv.Itoa(elapsedSeconds) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", elapsedSecondsStr) } fn main() { let elapsed_seconds: i32 = 22; let elapsed_seconds_str: String = elapsed_seconds.to_string(); println!(\"{}\", elapsed_seconds_str) } fun main() { val elapsedSeconds: Int = 22 val elapsedSecondsStr: String = elapsedSeconds.toString() println(elapsedSecondsStr) } using System; public class Int2Str { public static void Main() { int elapsedSeconds = 22; string elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.ToString(); Console.WriteLine(elapsedSecondsStr); } } let elapsedSeconds = 22; let elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.toString(); console.log(elapsedSecondsStr); elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = elapsed_seconds.to_s puts elapsed_seconds_str Example 10. elapsedSeconds parameter \"22\" The lang parameter defines the interface language for the HTTPS fallback page that is shown to the user when there are technical problems regarding opening device links (for example, if user’s browser does not support Web2App links and needs to be configured to allow them or if Smart-ID app is not installed on the phone). Its format must be ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It is recommended that for consistent user experience, RP provides here the same language that the user was already using in the RP UI. This parameter only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. Example 11. lang parameter \"eng\" authCode parameter generation is explained in detail in authCode calculation page. The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters involved in device link construction should be accessible by which parties (see legend below). The table also includes parameters which are used for authCode calculation (e.g. unprotectedDeviceLink) — for their descriptions, see authCode calculation page. RP API server RP backend RP frontend/app version sessionID sessionToken sessionSecret deviceLinkType sessionType signatureProtocol rpChallenge digest relyingPartyName brokeredRpName interactions initialCallbackUrl unprotectedDeviceLink elapsedSeconds authCode lang Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - does not know parameter - MUST NOT know parameter For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW should be used. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal size for QR code is ~10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. IMPORTANT The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, however the device link embedded in the QR code must only be generated by the PR backend. Keep in mind that regardless of the approach chosen, sensitive parameters such as sessionSecret must never be sent to the RP frontend itself. For cases when the app is not installed or some other problem occurs with opening a device link, a fallback HTTPS webpage is opened with instructions on how to resolve the issue. The lang parameter in the link is by default used to show the same language as on the RP UI. The instructions cover the following scenarios: User is not on a mobile device where Smart-ID app is installed and has been allowed by the RP to use a wrong type of device link (e.g. a same-device link on a PC). Smart-ID App is not installed on the current device. Mobile browser does not support universal links / Android App links. Mobile OS/browser settings disallow the link and user intervention is required.","title":"Device link flows","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.3","name":"device_link_flows","url":"/rp-api/3.1.3/device_link_flows.html","titles":[{"text":"Device link calculation","hash":"_device_link_calculation","id":1},{"text":"Same-device flows","hash":"same_device_flows","id":2},{"text":"Cross-device (dynamic QR code) flows","hash":"cross_device_flows","id":3},{"text":"Device link parameters","hash":"_device_link_parameters","id":4},{"text":"version parameter","hash":"_version_parameter","id":5},{"text":"sessionToken parameter","hash":"_sessiontoken_parameter","id":6},{"text":"deviceLinkType parameter","hash":"_devicelinktype_parameter","id":7},{"text":"sessionType parameter","hash":"_sessiontype_parameter","id":8},{"text":"elapsedSeconds parameter","hash":"_elapsedseconds_parameter","id":9},{"text":"lang parameter","hash":"_lang_parameter","id":10},{"text":"authCode parameter","hash":"_authcode_parameter","id":11},{"text":"Parameter visibility","hash":"_parameter_visibility","id":12},{"text":"Device link and QR presentation","hash":"device_link_and_qr_presentation","id":13},{"text":"Fallback page","hash":"fallback_page","id":14}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Smart-ID account A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID system. Account binds a Smart-ID app instance (installed on a person’s mobile device) to a person’s identity in the Smart-ID system. In the course of account creation and registration, the identity of the account owner (person) is proofed by a Registration Authority (RA) and the relation between the identity and a key pair is certified by a Certificate Authority (CA). An account has a signature key pair and an authentication key pair. Smart-ID app A technical component of the Smart-ID system. A mobile app instance installed on a person’s mobile device that provides access to Smart-ID functionality for persons. Smart-ID provider An organization that is legally responsible for the Smart-ID system. Smart-ID server A technical component of the Smart-ID system. Server-side counterpart of the Smart-ID app. Handles backend operations and provides API-s to Relying Party (RP). Smart-ID system A technical and organizational environment that enables digital authentication and issuing of digital signatures of persons in an electronic environment. The Smart-ID system provides services that allow persons (Smart-ID account owners) to authenticate themselves to RPs, to give digital signatures requested by RPs, and to manage their Smart-ID accounts. Authentication key pair (or authentication key) Key pair that is used to digitally authenticate a person. Certificate Authority (CA) An entity that issues certificates for Smart-ID account owners. Cross-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in a different device. These use cases are usually used with dynamic QR codes and notification flows. Key pair Pair of keys that are required for digital signature scheme. There are two kinds of key pairs (or shortly, keys) in the Smart-ID system, authentication key pair and signature key pair. The word pair refers to the private and public keys of each key pair used in an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, here RSA. Mobile device A tablet computer or smartphone that runs a mobile device operating system (Apple iOS, Google Android). Person A natural person who uses the Smart-ID system to authenticate herself to an RP and to issue digital signatures requested by RP. Registration Authority (RA) An entity responsible for recording or verifying some or all of the information (particularly the identities of subjects) needed by a CA to issue certificates and CRLs and to perform other certificate management functions. Relying Party (RP) An organization or service, for example a bank, that uses the Smart-ID service to authenticate its users and to get them to sign the documents. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Mobile-ID or Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures. The website is integrated with the Mobile-ID RP API (https://github.com/SK-EID/MID) or the Smart-ID RP API (https://github.com/SK-EID/smart-id-documentation). App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Users Natural persons with registered Mobile-ID/Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. Relying Party request A request from an RP that requires some kind of operation in the Smart-ID backend system. It may or may not create a transaction. Same-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in the same device. Signature key pair (or signature key) Key pair that is used to give digital signatures of a person.

Different interactions can support different amount of data to display information to user. Available interactions and possible type value and extra parameter combinations are listed in the following table. Availability depends on the chosen link flow. Linked notification based flow refers to the BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint. Each interaction is defined by an object that has 2 parameters: type and either displayText60 or displayText200. Interaction type & extra parameter Description Device link based flows Notification based flows Linked notification based flow displayTextAndPIN with displayText60 The simplest interaction with max 60 chars of text and PIN entry on a single screen. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessage with displayText200 First screen is for text only (max 200 chars) and has Confirm and Cancel buttons. Second screen is for PIN. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice with displayText200 First screen combines text and Verification Code choice. Second screen is for PIN. No Yes No RP uses interactions parameter to list interactions it allows for the current session. The interactions parameter is a JSON array that is Base64 encoded. Not all app versions may support all interactions. The order of the array items are significant as the Smart-ID server is aware of which app installations support which interactions and will send the interactions to the Smart-ID app in the same order as they are in the interactions array. IMPORTANT The following requirements apply for the interaction object: For each interaction, the type and the corresponding displayText (either displayText60 or displayText200) parameters are mandatory. Meaning that each interaction must include a non-empty displayText60 or displayText200 parameter. It is forbidden to provide both displayText60 and displayText200 parameters. It is not allowed to have more than one interaction with the same type value. In addition, it is not allowed to list interaction types not meant for the flow (device link flow or notification based flow). JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional). Therefore, the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be stored and reused in all subsequent calculations. This is relevant for all device link flows, more specifically in: authCode calculation; ACSP_V2 digest calculation (authentication only) during response verification. Failing to meet the first 4 requirements above will result in an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request). Failing to follow the last recommendation can result in some dynamic link sessions failing. If authCode calculation returns a different value from what RP API calculates, then the device link will be rejected due to wrong authCode value. If ACSP_V2 digest is calculated incorrectly, a valid user authentication signature will appear to be invalid and RP will have to deny the authentication attempt. The interaction that was actually used is reported back to RP with interactionTypeUsed response parameter to the session request. If an app cannot support any interaction requested then the session is cancelled with reason code REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP. The displayText60 and displayText200 parameters are used by the Smart-ID app to display text on the screen. These parameters must be short and clear. The preferred way of writing displayText60 and displayText200 is to explain the action user is taking. Interaction type must also be considered when writing a good display text. The following are a few examples of good displayText60 and displayText200: You are logging in to internet bank Log in to mobile banking Sign internet banking contract Sign document Contract.asice Transfer 1000€ to Jane Doe the RP name is not written explicitly as for all interaction types, the RP name is always displayed to the user together with the display text. Before sending the RP API request, interactions array must be turned into a string and then must be Base64 encoded. interactions should be minified to lower the overhead.

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases, i.e. authentication and signing. The main Smart-ID use case is of a relying party (RP) starting a session by calling the Smart-ID service RP API with a challenge when the user wishes to authenticate with the relying party’s service or a hash to create a digital signature. Depending on the chosen RP API endpoint, either the user scans a dynamic QR code or (in the same-device use case) the user clicks a link that launches the Smart-ID application, or the Smart-ID server sends a push notification to the application. The user then verifies the details of the transaction displayed by the Smart-ID application and confirms it. The Smart-ID application communicates with the Smart-ID server to generate the digital signature which makes it available for the relying party to be fetched. Meanwhile, the relying party has been waiting for a reply from the Smart-ID server using a long poll connection. In the case of success, it receives the signature and the user’s certificate to validate the result. The service creates digital signatures as proof of authentication and signing. However, to create electronic signatures (ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES signatures or PDF with PAdES signatures) the relying party must create the required document structure themselves, calculate the hash and have that signed using this API. The latest version of the API introduces new flows collectively referred to as \"device link flows\". for cross-device use cases — dynamic QR codes that the user must scan; for same-device use cases where the user is visiting an RP webpage using a mobile browser — device links which the user must click; for same-device use cases where the user is using an RP app — device links which the user must click. The guiding principle in designing the API has been to unify the three aforementioned flows as much as possible to minimize the integration efforts for RPs. Because of this, they mostly share the same security mechanisms and principles, even though the methods used to launch the Smart-ID application are completely different. This also means it is possible for an RP to offer multiple alternative methods of authentication at the same time without making multiple requests to the RP API. In the latest RP API version 3, the notification based flows will still be available, but for maximum security, it is recommended they are only used if the particular user has been authenticated at least once before on the device by one of the more secure device link flows. This can be accomplished by utilizing the client device’s local storage (e.g. browser cookies, local app storage). Device link based flows must always be used in the same-device use case for both usability and security reasons. Brokers of the Smart-ID service are treated similarly to relying parties and there is no extra configuration compared to previous RP API versions. Throughout this document, there will be some blocks of text as shown below. IMPORTANT Important blocks like these must be followed by every RP without exceptions. These blocks show important points of the API which might lead to security issues or failures if implemented wrongly. NOTE Note blocks present additional information and optional features. They also link to other related sections in the guide.","title":"Introduction","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.3","name":"introduction","url":"/rp-api/3.1.3/introduction.html","titles":[{"text":"About RP API v3","hash":"_about_rp_api_v3","id":1},{"text":"About this document","hash":"_about_this_document","id":2}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"In general, notification based flows are similar to the flows from RP API v2 in the sense that they rely on the push notifications mechanism. The main differences with regard to RP API v2 are: For signature requests, verification codes are returned to the RP from server, not calculated by the RP; There are changes to the signature protocols of authentication and signature requests. Below, sequence diagrams are given along with explanations of the differences. The following diagram describes the notification based flow for the authentication session. The following sequence diagram illustrates the notification based signing flow. The following sequence diagram illustrates the device link based certificate choice flow being linked to a notification based signing flow. There are separate signing protocols for authentication and signature requests (see signature protocols for details). In RP API v3 notification based authentication requests, RP must compute verification codes (VC) for each authentication request, so the user can bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. The VC is computed as follows: Calculate SHA-256 from the rpChallenge, extract 2 rightmost bytes from the result, interpret them as a big-endian unsigned integer and take the last 4 digits in decimal form for display. SHA-256 must be used to calculate the VC. Please keep in mind that the rpChallenge is the real rpChallenge byte value (for example, the byte array returned from the SecureRandom() or equivalent method), not the Base64 encoded form used for transport or the popular hexadecimal representation. The VC value must be displayed to the user in the browser together with a message asking the end user to verify the code matches with the one displayed on their mobile device. The user must not proceed if these don’t match. integer(SHA-256(rpChallenge)[-2:-1]) mod 10000 Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.math.BigInteger; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.security.MessageDigest; import java.util.Base64; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode( rpChallengeBase64 ); MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); md.update(rpChallengeBytes); byte[] sha256Hash = md.digest(); BigInteger LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK = new BigInteger(\"65535\"); BigInteger result = new BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(new BigInteger(\"10000\")); String verificationCode = String.format(\"%04d\", result); System.out.println(verificationCode); } } <?php $rpChallengeBase64 = base64_decode('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg=='); $sha256Hash = hash('sha256', $rpChallengeBase64, true); $result = hexdec(bin2hex(substr($sha256Hash, -2))) % 10000; $verificationCode = sprintf('%04d', $result); echo $verificationCode; ?> import base64 import hashlib rp_challenge_base64 = b\"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" rp_challenge_bytes = base64.b64decode(rp_challenge_base64) sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(rp_challenge_bytes).digest() result = int.from_bytes(sha256_hash[-2:], byteorder='big') % 10000 verification_code = f\"{result:04d}\" print(verification_code) package main import ( \"crypto/sha256\" \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var rpChallengeBase64 string = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" var rpChallengeBytes, err = base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(rpChallengeBase64) if err != nil { panic(err) } var sha256Hash [32]byte = sha256.Sum256(rpChallengeBytes) var result int = int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-2])<<8 + int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-1]) result %= 10000 var verificationCode string = fmt.Sprintf(\"%04d\", result) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\",verificationCode) } use base64::decode; use sha2::{Sha256, Digest}; fn main() { let rp_challenge_base64: &str = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; let rp_challenge_bytes = decode(rp_challenge_base64).unwrap(); let sha256_hash = Sha256::digest(&rp_challenge_bytes); let result = (((sha256_hash[30] as u16) << 8) + (sha256_hash[31] as u16)) % 10000; let verification_code: String = format!(\"{:04}\", result); println!(\"{}\", verification_code); } import java.math.BigInteger import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets import java.security.MessageDigest import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val rpChallengeBase64: String = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" val rpChallengeBytes: ByteArray = Base64.getDecoder().decode(rpChallengeBase64) val sha256Hash: ByteArray = MessageDigest .getInstance(\"SHA-256\") .digest(rpChallengeBytes) val LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK: BigInteger = BigInteger(\"65535\") val result: BigInteger = BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(BigInteger(\"10000\")) val verificationCode = \"%04d\".format(result) println(verificationCode) } using System; using System.Security.Cryptography; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void Main(string[] args) { string rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(rpChallengeBase64); using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create()) { byte[] sha256Hash = sha256.ComputeHash(rpChallengeBytes); int result = ((sha256Hash[30] << 8) + (sha256Hash[31])) % 10000; string verificationCode = result.ToString(\"D4\"); Console.WriteLine(verificationCode); } } } const crypto = require('crypto'); const rpChallenge = Buffer.from('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==', 'base64'); const sha256 = crypto.createHash('sha256'); sha256.update(rpChallenge); const sha256Hash = sha256.digest(); const result = sha256Hash.readUInt16BE(30) % 10000 .toString() .padStart(4, '0'); console.log(result); require 'base64' require 'digest' rp_challenge = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" sha256_hash = Digest::SHA256.digest(Base64.decode64(rp_challenge)) last_2_bytes = sha256_hash[-2..-1].unpack('n*').first result = (last_2_bytes % 10_000).to_s.rjust(4, '0') puts result Example 1.

The first four are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fifth is a GET request used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The POST v3/authentication/* session endpoints are used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the POST v3/signature/* session endpoints are used to create digital signatures; the POST v3/signature/certificate-choice/* session endpoints are used when the document number is not known immediately prior to the signature session and the user’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; the POST v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} endpoint is used to obtain the signing certificate of the requested document number; finally, the GET v3/session/{sessionID} status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. The implementation details are described on the OpenAPI specification page. There are two types of flows that can be used in v3/authentication/*, v3/signature/* and v3/signature/certificate-choice/* sessions - the device link based flow and the notification based flow. IMPORTANT In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only use device link based flows or only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a device link based flow beforehand. It is up to the RP to decide how to securely identify such devices/browsers and tie them to the Smart-ID document-number by utilizing browser cookies, local app storage or other means. For example using the User-Agent field for device/browser identification is not secure and should be avoided as it can be easily spoofed by a malicious party. There are different ways to reference users - via their issued identifier, a document number linking a specific account or even not at all (in case of device link based flows). The different object references are described on the OpenAPI specification page. IMPORTANT Once a user has been identified within the RP session, then in subsequent signing, certificate-choice and re-authentication session requests the document number reference should be used. The main use cases and which sessions and flows to use are described below. Utilizing the RP API as described below provides the best user experience and security. In the URL examples below and other pages BASE refers to the RP API base address https://rp-api.smart-id.com The following diagram shows main authentication flows and which endpoints to use. The following diagram shows main signature flows and which endpoints to use. Use case: The RP session is on a separate device from the mobile phone where the Smart-ID app is installed. For example, the user is using a PC browser to access an RP website or a tablet to access an RP application. Use case: The RP frontend (whether an RP app or website accessed by a mobile browser) resides on the same mobile device as the Smart-ID app. The end user is using a mobile app or RP detects that the user is on a mobile browser so it can be assumed that the user intends to use the Smart-ID app on a same device. Strongly prefer the BASE/v3/*/device-link/anonymous endpoints for same-device use cases unless the user’s document-number has already been established for the current session. These endpoints provide a superior user experience as no user identifier entry is required while the device-links with callbacks provide the best security protections. However, a fallback option should also be provided to switch to the cross-device use cases. Using the device link based flow with QR codes is the most secure option and should be preferred. RP may call the anonymous device link based authentication session endpoint and display a dynamic QR code that the user must scan with the Smart-ID app or show a same-device (Web2App, App2App) link the user can interact with. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/anonymous Instead of using the anonymous authentication session endpoint, the RP may request the user to enter their user identifier and utilize the non-anonymous authentication session endpoint. This may be beneficial when the RP utilizes custom usernames and has the users' identifiers stored internally. The RP may simply always ask the user for the identifier as well. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint should be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/document/{document-number} Notification based authentication session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. Using a notification based authentication session endpoint triggers a push notification to all the user’s devices instead of the user scanning the QR code or clicking the same-device link. BASE/v3/authentication/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint can be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/notification/document/{document-number} If a user has already logged onto the RP app or website using Smart-ID authentication, the RP can call the certificate session endpoint to obtain the user’s signing certificate. As the document number is attained from the preceding authentication call, no user interaction is required for the certificate-choice session and the RP API can immediately provide the certificate. BASE/v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} The RP can then call the device link based signature session endpoint to sign using the same Smart-ID account that was used for authentication. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/document/{document-number} The notification based signature session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} If possible, the Smart-ID authentication should be performed before signing and (and after that is completed, instructions in Signing with prior Smart-ID authentication should be followed). In case no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, and certificate is required, the anonymous device link based certificate-choice session endpoint should be used. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/device-link/anonymous Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must call the notification based linked signature session endpoint and provide the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter (session ID of the previous certificate-choice session) to connect the signature and certificate-choice sessions. BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number} The combination of device link based certificate-choice and notification based linked signature session endpoints provides the optimal user experience where Smart-ID app is launched only once and a VC code is not shown. If the certificate-choice session was completed using a same-device device link, after the flow is completed, the Smart-ID app will launch the callbackUrl given in the device link based certificate-choice. NOTE In the flow described above, it is recommended to stop showing the QR code, Web2App or App2App link in the RP UI after the certificate is obtained. If the certificate is not required, or is already known, the device link based signature session endpoint should be called instead. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} NOTE There is no anonymous device link based signature session endpoint, since in all practical signing use cases the user’s identity is known beforehand. Notification based certificate-choice session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose but is not recommended. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must display the VC and call notification based signature session endpoint. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} IMPORTANT Notification based certificate-choice cannot be connected to notification based linked signature session endpoint with linkedSessionID. If notification based certificate-choice is used, VC code must still be shown to the user, and in same-device use cases, there might be usability issues with VC being shown too fast or not being shown at all (this is especially problematic for interactions involving confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice).","title":"Overview","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.3","name":"overview","url":"/rp-api/3.1.3/overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Cross-device use cases","hash":"cross_device_use_cases","id":1},{"text":"Same-device use cases","hash":"same_device_use_cases","id":2},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":3},{"text":"Notification based authentication","hash":"_notification_based_authentication","id":4},{"text":"Signing","hash":"_signing","id":5},{"text":"Signing with prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"signing_with_prior_authentication","id":6},{"text":"Notification based signing with prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_with_prior_smart_id_authentication","id":7},{"text":"Signing without prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"_signing_without_prior_smart_id_authentication","id":8},{"text":"Notification based signing without prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_without_prior_smart_id_authentication","id":9}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"After receiving the transaction response from the session status API call the following algorithm must be used to decide if the authentication result is trustworthy and what the identity of the authenticating end user is, if the signature result is valid. In App2App and Web2App flows, the response verification step must be performed after the user has returned via the callback URL, as described in Callback URLs page. The following steps perform the response verification algorithm. Note that the algorithm is applicable to both authentication and signature session flows. Specific differences, such as the conditional execution of Steps 1 and 2, are noted within the steps. Session secret verification (applicable only for sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret string received in the initial request. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Obtain the sessionSecretDigest value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the sessionSecretDigest obtained from the callback URL. User challenge verification (applicable only for authentication sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Obtain the userChallengeVerifier value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the received userChallengeVerifier string. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the signature.userChallenge string provided in the JSON response’s signature object. Initial session response check: Verify the state field in the JSON response is exactly COMPLETE. Verify the result.endResult field is exactly OK. Verify the signatureProtocol field is exactly ACSP_V2 in case of authentication or RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE in case of signature. Ensure the cert, signature, and result objects are present and not null. Certificate Chain Validation and Trust: Decode the Base64 encoded end-entity certificate string from cert.value and parse it into a standard X.509 certificate representation. The RP API provides only the end-entity certificate, the Relying Party must have the necessary root and intermediate CA certificates configured locally to allow the library to build the full certificate chain. For these certificates, see Certificates page. Using a standard cryptographic library, initiate the validation of the certificate chain starting from the end-entity certificate. Provide the end-entity certificate to the library, along with configuring it with the set of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors). It’s important to note that some libraries use the system certificate store in addition to the provided CA certificates, this should be disabled and only the explicitly configured CA certificates should be used. For each certificate in the constructed chain (end-entity certificate and all intermediate CA certificates), perform the following checks. A standard cryptographic library will typically perform the following checks as part of its overall chain validation routine and report the result as a success or failure. Verify the certificate’s digital signature using the public key of its issuer certificate. Verify the certificate’s validity period against the current time, i.e., not before the notBefore date and not after the notAfter date. Verify that the certificate has not been revoked. This check should be performed using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), utilizing the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension within the certificate to locate the OCSP responder URL. If OCSP fails or is unavailable, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking should be used as fallback. Note: Revocation checks (OCSP/CRL) are not performed on self-signed root CA certificates configured as trust anchors. Intermediate CA certificates can be revoked and must be checked. Note: OCSP responses are digitally signed. The certificate chain of the OCSP responder itself should also be verified, ensuring it is trusted and authorized to provide status for the certificate being checked. Verify basic constraints are appropriate: Intermediate CA certificates must have the Basic Constraints extension present with the cA boolean set to TRUE. For end-entity certificates, the Basic Constraints extension should either absent, or if present, its cA boolean should be set to FALSE. Smart-ID Scheme Identification (End-Entity Certificate): Before checking specific purposes, verify that the end-entity certificate belongs to the Smart-ID scheme. Examine the Certificate Policies extension of the end-entity certificate. The certificate must contain all the specific policy OIDs designated by SK ID Solutions for the Smart-ID scheme (as defined in Chapter 2.2.3 of the \"Smart-ID Certificate and OCSP Profile\" in Certificate Profiles page). These OIDs differentiate Smart-ID certificates from other types of certificates (e.g., Mobile-ID, Estonian ID-card). The Relying Party must consult the current official SK ID Solutions Certificate Policies for the definitive list of Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs. For these certificate policies, see Certificate Policies page. If not all the recognized Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs are present, the certificate should not be processed as a Smart-ID certificate, and the verification should fail for this context. End-Entity Certificate Purpose Validation (Smart-ID Context): Examine the end-entity certificate for extensions and attributes required by the certificate profile. For these certificate profiles, see Certificate Profiles page. For Smart-ID authentication: To confirm the certificate is suitable for authentication, it must contain one of the following: The digitalSignature key usage and the Smart-ID authentication (1.3.6.1.4.1.62306.5.7.0) Extended Key Usage which is present in certificates issued April 2025 onwards. The digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment key usages and the id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) Extended Key Usage which is found in older, still valid certificates issued before April 2025. For digital signing: Check for appropriate key usage nonRepudiation. Assurance Level Check: Extract the assurance level string from cert.certificateLevel (e.g., ADVANCED, QUALIFIED). For qualified certificates, check that the extension values as defined by the certificate profile exist within the certificate from cert.value. Compare this level against the minimum assurance level required by the RP for the specific context or transaction. Ensure the certificate’s level meets or exceeds the required level (note that ADVANCED < QUALIFIED). Identity Match Check: Extract the authenticated user’s identifier from the end-entity certificate. For Smart-ID certificates serialNumber (OID 2.5.4.5) under Subject DN contain the national identity code, for example PNOEE-30001010004. If the RP initiated the authentication or signing for a specific known user, verify that the extracted identifier matches the expected identity for that session. Verification of signature Object (authentication/signature session): Only for authentication session: Reconstruct the exact ACSP_V2_payload string that was signed, as described under ACSP_V2 digest calculation. This is done by concatenating the fields in order, separated by the vertical bar character '|' (U+007C): 'smart-id'|'ACSP_V2'|serverRandom|rpChallenge|userChallenge|BASE64(relyingPartyName)|BASE64(brokeredRpName)|BASE64(SHA-256(interactions))|interactionTypeUsed|initialCallbackUrl|flowType Only for signature session: Use the data-to-be-signed, a digest of which was initially sent when initiating the signature session (as described in RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol). Decode the signature value from signature.value using Base64 decoding. Obtain the public key from the parsed end-entity user certificate (from Step 4). Only for authentication session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against the UTF-8 bytes of the reconstructed ACSP_V2_payload string. Only for signature session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against either the data-to-be-signed or the hash of the data-to-be-signed (there are libraries that provide options for either). Ensure the verification uses the algorithm specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm (e.g., rsassa-pss) and correctly applies the parameters from signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters (e.g., hash algorithm like SHA-512, MGF1 hash like SHA-512, salt length like 64, and the trailer field 0xbc). Session Management (Only for authentication sessions. Important: only perform if all the preceding steps (1-9) were successful): Invalidate any previous, unauthenticated session identifier associated with the user’s interaction (e.g., browser cookie or API token used before successful authentication). Generate a new, secure, and unique session identifier representing the now authenticated state. Associate the authenticated user’s identity (from Step 8) and potentially the assurance level (from Step 7) with this new session identifier in your server-side session store.

After the updates it will be restructured and integrated into the rest of the RP API documentation. Although ID-card, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID are all secure technologies for authentication and digital signing, e-service providers (Relying Parties, RPs) need to consider potential risks, which are associated with digital authentication solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users to understand the context of their actions and to protect them from possible attacks. For example, there might be a malicious phishing website controlled by attacker between user’s browser and the RP’s website. This document lists attacks that can be launched against RP’s website or RP’s app, when the RP is using ID-card, Mobile-ID or Smart-ID for authentication and digital signatures. Both user interface options (browser and app) are considered and when it is not specifically stated, attacks and proposed countermeasures are relevant for both cases. Effective security measures for mitigating attacks are described in the following sections. Some security conscious RPs have already deployed them. Others should also consider implementing and deploying these measures and defences to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Guidelines are written in affirmative and imperative mood, however, not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else, who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the relying party’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures. All feedback to this document and proposed security measures is much appreciated. Please send it to the e-mail address support@sk.ee on the Secure Implementation Guidance. This section describes common attacks, which have been tried in the past against RPs, against their users and against SK ID Solutions. Giving a brief overview of the attacks is necessary as it may be the case some RPs are not aware of some of the attacks and may erroneously think they are safe. Also, not all countermeasures are effective against every possible attack. RPs will need to consider, which attacks could have the most devastating impact on their business and therefore, which countermeasures should be deployed first. Attacks are described in a generic way and don’t differentiate between browser, app, ID-cards, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID. User starts the login process on the RP’s website or app. They enter national identity code, but sometimes make a small error in the code. By random chance the entered incorrect code corresponds to another real person, who also has a Smart-ID or Mobile-ID account. Smart-ID/Mobile-ID system initiates the authentication transaction for the wrong user and the phone of another user wakes up and displays the authentication consent screen. It has occurred in the past the other user accepted the foreign consent dialog without verifying it and without having second thoughts confirmed it by entering PIN1, behaving almost like on auto-pilot. The session of the original user was then authenticated by the RP’s website, although the original user is logged into the wrong person’s account. There was no malicious attempt in the beginning, it was purely accidental error by both users. In this case, an attacker is specifically targeting some particular user. The attacker tries to irritate and to annoy the user by repeatedly initiating an authentication session with the user’s identity. This sends nefarious Smart-ID/Mobile-ID notifications to the user’s phone and disturbs normal phone usage. Attacker could ask for a ransom to cease the attack or simply cause inconvenience as a revenge. In a more advanced situation, an attacker targets the RP itself and starts many authentication sessions with the app or website of RP, using some scripted and automated tools. The attacker could use random usernames and generated national identity codes and this results nefarious notifications on phones of multiple users and disturbs normal phone usage. Not only does this cause inconvenience to users, but also, this kind of attack could result in a large number of complaints to SK ID Solutions and SK could be forced to temporarily cut off the Smart-ID and/or Mobile-ID service to the RP. This results in the outage of the RP’s website or app, because other users cannot login either. Attacker could ask for a ransom to cease the attack or simply cause damage as a revenge. An advanced version of this attack targets multiple RP’s and in such a widespread attack, SK could be forced to temporarily cut off the Smart-ID and/or Mobile-ID service to those RPs, who are not able to filter the malicious authentication attempts by themselves. An attacker is trying to extract and deduce information about Mobile-ID/Smart-ID users through the RP’s website or other information systems or software. For example, the attacker initiates a Smart-ID authentication session on the RP’s website with a generated national identity code. If no error message is returned, the attacker can deduce that this particular user has a Smart-ID account and it may be worthwhile to try some further attacks against that particular user. In more advanced situation, the attacker may be able to use the RP’s information system to download the user’s signing certificate. Phishing attacks are intended to confuse users and to gain access to the RP’s e-service under the user’s name. Usually, these attacks are automated and distributed in large quantities via spam e-mails. The attacker hopes some percentage of users, who are not aware of risks and are not careful, will \"take the bait\" and be \"hooked\". Hence, the name \"phishing\" (fishing). However, e-mail and browsers are not the only attack vector. In case the RP requires digital signatures in order to commit an operation or transaction on the e-service, the attacker tries to further confuse the user and will try to get the user to enter PIN2 for the signing request as well. Previously, phishing has been attempted in a manual (non-automated) ways and with simple (static) counterfeit websites. However, with advances in attack tools, more powerful attackers must be considered. Nowadays, they are able to build authentic looking and well-functioning dynamic websites, which proxy authentic HTML pages and images from the original website of the RP. General steps of such kind of phishing attacks are following: An attacker sends users a phishing e-mail with a URL to the proxy website and waits until the user connects to the attacker’s website. Automatic tools then connect from the proxy website to the original website of the RP. The user enters all the required information (username, national identity code, …​) and starts authenticating on the attacker’s website. The proxy website sends the same information to the original website and starts the same kind of authentication session there as well and mediates back the correct Mobile-ID/Smart-ID verification code and any other displayed information. The user sees the authentication dialog on the mobile device, with correct serviceName, correct displayText and correct verification code. The user will consent to the authentication dialog and enters PIN1, although the attacker’s proxy will be logged in to the user’s account at the RP’s website. After logging in, the attacker’s proxy waits until the user initiates the operation or transaction and changes details of the transaction on the fly (for example, change the destination bank account number of the transfer order) and starts the changed transaction on the original website. The user enters the PIN2 to confirm the transaction, but it will be the attacker’s changed transaction that will be executed. An attacker makes a phone call to a user, posing as an employee of the RP (or some other authoritative person, for example, police officer) and persuades the user that they need to perform a Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication in order to confirm something fictional. General steps of such kind of phishing attacks are following: An attacker gathers the required information (username, national identity code, …​) from the user or has already them at hand before the phone call. The attacker navigates with the browser to the RP’s original website and starts the authentication session under the name of the user. Website initiates the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication and displays the verification code to the attacker. (Instead of the website, the attacker could use the RP’s app as well.) The attacker informs the user that Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication needs to be performed and tells them the verification code and asks to complete the authentication on the mobile device. The user verifies the authentication dialog on the device, consents and enters PIN1. The Browser of the attacker is logged into the RP’s website under the user’s identity. The attacker starts an operation (for example, a transfer order) on the RP’s website. The website initiates the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID digital signature operation and displays the verification code to the attacker. The attacker informs the user, still on the phone call, that Mobile-ID/Smart-ID digital signature needs to be created as well, and tells them the verification code and asks to complete the signing operation on the mobile device. The user verifies the digital signature dialog on the mobile device, consents and enters PIN2. The operation on the website of the RP is executed. This section lists security measures, which can be deployed by the RP itself in order to protect from threats and attacks listed in the previous section. This table describes proposed security measures. It includes the following information: In case the proposed security measure is considered mandatory for customers of SK ID Solutions, it is marked as \"MUST\". In case it is recommended, it is marked as \"SHOULD\". Information whether the security measure can be applied to websites and/or apps. Most of the measures are universal, but there are specific measures, such as \"keeping track of trusted browsers\" that apply only in certain situations. Information whether the security measure can be applied in case of ID-card, Mobile-ID and/or Smart-ID integration.

RP must implement the following checks and controls. Using simple means just to include a number of CA certificates in the TLS server configuation is not enough. SK ID Solutions uses many CAs and TLS server needs information about them all in order to build trust chains. However, not all of the CAs are used to issue ID-card certificates and this information needs to be manually added. It is important to explicitly specify, which CA-s are trusted to issue the certificates for the CCA authentication and which CAs are not trusted to do that. For example the OpenSSL utility can be used for that: cd /path/to/trusted_certificates_directory/ wget https://c.sk.ee/EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt wget https://www.sk.ee/upload/files/EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt wget https://c.sk.ee/esteid2018.pem.crt ... openssl x509 -addreject clientAuth -trustout -in EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt -out EE-GovCA2018_trusted.pem.crt openssl x509 -addreject clientAuth -trustout -in EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt -out EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA_trusted.pem.crt openssl x509 -addtrust clientAuth -trustout -in esteid2018.pem.crt -out esteid2018_trusted.pem.crt ... rm EE-GovCA2018.pem.crt rm EE_Certification_Centre_Root_CA.pem.crt rm esteid2018.pem.crt Note that it is important to include the certificate of root CAs and implicitly configure clientAuth reject for them. When configuring Apache in this way, it is also neccessary to use the SSLCADNRequestPath directive, which specifies the list of acceptable CA-s, which are sent to the client over the TLS handshake. cd /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ wget https://c.sk.ee/esteid2018.pem.crt openssl rehash /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ After specifying trust settings for individual certificates, allow TLS server to only trust these CAs and to request specific certificates from clients (configuration example is given for Apache mod_ssl): #... SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile ... SSLCertificateKeyFile ... SSLCACertificatePath /path/to/trusted_certificates_directory/ SSLCADNRequestPath /path/to/client_request_CAs_directory/ #... Web-eID provides authentication using a custom protocol instead of TLS CCA. When implementing it adhere to the requirements and configuration outlined in the documentation. Web-eID validation libraries handle correct verification of ID-card certificates on your behalf. Keeping the Web-eID software libraries updated is critical. https://web-eid.eu/ SK Identity Solutions provides OCSP service to check for the validity of issued certificates. More details are available at https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en/services/validity-confirmation-services/ Configuration example is given for Apache mod_ssl: #... SSLEngine on SSLOCSPEnable leaf SSLOCSPDefaultResponder \"http://responder.example.com:8888/responder\" SSLOCSPOverrideResponder on #... It is important to only accept these certificates, which correspond to production ID-cards, Digi-ID and other identity documents. An attacker could present other certificates as well and in some cases this might lead to a vulnerability. Issuance policy is recorded in the certificate extension X509v3 Certificate Policies and contains an OID identifier. Identifier values of issuance policies are listed at the page https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en/repository/CP/ and https://www.skidsolutions.eu/upload/files/SK-CPR-ESTEID2018-EN-v1_2_20200630.pdf. Following table compiles a helpful list of policies relevant to accept in the TLS-CCA authentication sessions.

RP would need to export the full client certificate from the TLS session to the application server and then apply filtering with PHP or other applications. Configuration example with Apache mod_ssl: #... SSLEngine on #... SSLOptions +ExportCertData #... and source code example with PHP: $cert = getenv('SSL_CLIENT_CERT'); $x509 = openssl_x509_parse($cert); $certificatePolicies = 'Policy: 1.3.6.1.4.1.51361.1.1.1'; if(preg_match(\"/$certificatePolicies$/m\", $x509['extensions']['certificatePolicies']) == 0) { echo \"OK\\n\"; } Note that demo code examples only use a single OID value. Production systems would have to use the whole table. It is important to only accept these certificates, which have the \"TLS Web Client Authentication\" extension and are issued by trusted CAs. Partial configuration example for Apache: #... <Location \"/\"> Require expr \"TLS Web Client Authentication, E-mail Protection\" in PeerExtList('extendedKeyUsage') </Location> #... and partial configuration example for F5 BIG-IP loadbalancer: when CLIENTSSL_CLIENTCERT { HTTP::release if { [SSL::cert count] < 1 } { reject } set client_cert [SSL::cert 0] set clientCA [X509::cert_fields $client_cert [SSL::verify_result] issuer ] #If issuer contains \"-SK 20\" assume it is a SK certificate and process further if {($clientCA contains \"-SK 20\") } { if {($clientCA contains \"ESTEID-SK 20\") } { #If issued by ESTEID check if it is mobile-id or not, mobile-ID profile doesn't have TLS web auth enabled if { !([X509::extensions $client_cert] contains \"TLS Web Client Authentication\") } { log local0. \"Invalid certificate used for authentication, IP: [IP::client_addr], Issued by: $clientCA\" reject } } else { #Not issued by ESTEID, shouldn't allow TLS auth log local0. \"Invalid certificate used for authentication, IP: [IP::client_addr], Issued by: $clientCA\" reject } } } serviceName is a short text string, displayed to the user in the Mobile-ID/Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent dialog. It helps user to verify that the request is coming from a trusted source. serviceName will be displayed on the top of the consent screen, in bold letters. SK ID Solutions have established basic requirements that serviceName should contain one of the following: name of the company, a DNS domain which your website is using, a registered trademark, associated with the website or app, which the user is interacting with, a brand name, associated with the website or app, which the user is interacting with. Generic serviceName, which does not help user to distinguish between different RP-s, are not accepted (such as \"login\", \"authentication\", etc). displayText is a short text string, displayed to the user in the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent dialog. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen, under the verification code number. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Mobile-ID or Smart-ID to authenticate users, who are calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence, that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent, who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. With signing operations, there’s also possibility to use much longer and descriptive displayText. For more details, see section Defence: show details of transactions in the displayText. At the basic security level, Smart-ID is using a 4-digit verification code, which is displayed to a user on the RP’s website and on the Smart-ID app. The user is expected to match these and thus verify they consent to the correct authentication or signature request. At more advanced security level, the RP can request the Smart-ID app should display three verification codes (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code, which is displayed by the RP’s website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice interaction type. More information in the API documentation: https://github.com/SK-EID/smart-id-documentation/tree/v2 In case the RP is using an app it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app, before the screen of the Smart-ID app is displayed. In order to increase trust and confidence in users, it is useful to show details of the last successful session. The RP must prominently display the information about the last authentication, including such elements: Date and time of the last successful authentication. Geographic location (country) of the last successful authentication. Short human readable description of the browser last used for successful authentication (such as \"Chrome on Windows\", \"Safari on Mac\"), deduced from the browser’s user-Agent header. This will help users to recognise the last login details and increase their confidence that nobody else has accessed their account after their last login. If they don’t recognise the last session, the user can contact the RP’s user support and raise the alarm. With password-based authentication systems, it was a good practice (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#authentication-responses) to show same error message for two cases: username was incorrect and the account didn’t exist, and username was correct, but the password was incorrect. This helps to prevent the user account enumeration (WSTG-IDNT-04). With Mobile-ID and Smart-ID services, following the same principle helps to prevent data mining for attack preparation. It also makes some phishing attacks more difficult. Mobile-ID RP API and Smart-ID RP API return different error codes to help debuging: Mobile-ID RP API, HTTP 200, \"result\": \"NOT_MID_CLIENT\" — \"Given user has no active certificates and is not MID client\" Smart-ID RP API, HTTP 404 — \"object described in URL was not found, essentially meaning that the user does not have an account in Smart-ID system\" Smart-ID RP API, HTTP 471 — \"No suitable account of requested type found, but user has some other accounts\" However, it is the reponsibility of the RP not to show different UI messages for those cases, but to follow generic, uniform pattern: Request new authentication session from the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID API with the user identifier. In case the API responded with the new authentication session: Display the text \"Authentication session started, verification code 1234\" with the value of the verification code given by Mobile-ID or Smart-ID API In case the authentication is successful, continue with the login In case the authentication session is timed out after 120 seconds, show the error message \"User account not found or user didn’t responded in time\" In case the API responded with \"NOT_MID_CLIENT\" or \"HTTP 404\" or \"HTTP 471\": Generate random verification code value Display the text \"Authentication session started, verification code 1234\" Wait for 120 seconds and then show the error message \"User account not found or user didn’t responded in time\" Good design of the website should include a way for a user to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on the user’s account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognise and that could point to security incidents. On the other hand, when the user does recognise all the history, it will increase the trust in the website and services of the RP. Also, the RP must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. displayText is a short text string, displayed to a user in the Smart-ID signing consent dialog that helps the user understand the context of the operation. There are two options for the string length of the displayText: short displayText string can be up to 60 characters and it will be displayed as a single line below the verification code, on the same screen as the keypad for entering PIN2. longer displayText string can be up to 200 characters and it will be displayed on a separate screen to gain the user’s attention. In case there’s an advanced phishing attack in progress and an attacker is presenting a modified website to the user, with the modified operation details, such as destination account number of the transfer order, the user cannot detect the attack solely with the user’s browser. However, the string of the displayText is coming directly from the RP and the attacker cannot modify it to deceive the user. This way, the RP can use a secondary authentic channel to allow the user to verify and confirm the operation. A common way to start the Mobile-ID or Smart-ID authentication is to ask for a user identifier, either the phone number or national identity number. However, these numbers are not secret and even though they are not outright published, there are ways for an attacker to obtain the national identity number of the user and start authenticating on their behalf. It is also possible for the attacker to create automated scripts to simply generate a list of numbers and try them all to start many authentication sessions under the name of multiple users. A better approach is to ask for an additional identifier. With Mobile-ID, a good option is to ask for both phone number and national identity number. The Mobile-ID API verifies that those identifiers match with each other and doesn’t initiate the authentication session otherwise. With Smart-ID, a good option is to ask for national identity number and some not-so-public identifier as well. It could be a username, which the users can select by themselves, the account contract number or something else only the user knows and is convenient for them to remember and type. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whether the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to login from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. The tracking should be done with the HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage feature supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier. The status of each browser instance for the user is then tracked in the RP’s website database. The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The browser cookie has to be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags. The scope of the cookie has to be the URL of the RP’s website. In case of a phishing attack, the proxied website will be setup on a different URL and the browser will not send the value of that cookie to the attacker’s website. Therefore, the attacker cannot pose to the RP’s website as the trusted browser. In order to manage the data associated with the tracking, each user account must have the following extra data for each browser which the user has connected from in the past: displayName — Human recognisable description of the browser, like \"Chrome on Windows\" or \"Safari on my work Mac\", etc. Simple names with tolerable errors could be generated automatically from the browser’s User-Agent header with the help of software libraries and toolkits. The RP could also allow the user to edit this field, so that the user can provide their own meaningful names. lastSeen — Timestamp, when that browser was last used by the user to connect to the RP’s website. hashedTrackingID — Hashed value of the randomly generated identifier. Length of the identifier should be at least 32 bytes. The Base64 encoded clear-text value of the identifier is placed in the browser’s cookie and the hashed value is stored in the database. Storing only hashed values makes the database leak less dangerous. Salting hashes, a common practice when when storing passwords, is not required, because trackingID is already long enough with random bytes and additional protection against brute-forcing is not essential. trustLevel — Information about whether that browser instance could be considered trusted or not. Proposed algorithm uses values \"seenOnce\", \"seenTwice\" and \"trusted\". The RP could use more levels if required. Note that in case multiple users are using the same browser instance then the same hashedTrackingID value will be stored for multiple user accounts. Care must be taken to lookup the correct record, based on the user account, which is starting the authentication. A general algorithm to keep track of the browsers and to manage the trustLevel is described below. When the user navigates with the browser to the RP’s website and requests the Smart-ID authentication, the following cases are possible: If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is not known (i.e. the browser didn’t send the cookie value or the cookie value doesn’t match any value of hashedTrackingID in the user’s account) and the user doesn’t have any other browser’s trustLevel as \"trusted\", proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, the RP should update the browser’s trustLevel as \"seenOnce\". If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is not known and the user already has at least one other browser as \"trusted\", then the situation indicates a possible phishing attack. The RP should perform additional checks and controls. If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"trusted\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication. The situation indicates somewhat lower risk and the RP could decide not to execute some security measures, which are required otherwise, for example, asking the user to enter multiple identifiers. After successful authentication, the RP should update the lastSeen timestamp. If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"seenOnce\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, if the lastSeen timestamp was older than 24 hours, the browser’s trustLevel will be updated as \"seenTwice\". If the connecting browser’s trustLevel is \"seenTwice\", then the RP should proceed with the authentication as usual. After the successful authentication, if the lastSeen timestamp was older than 24 hours, the browser’s trustLevel will be set as \"trusted\". The described algorithm can be implemented and silently deployed by the RP without any additional security measures or checks actually performed in the first phase. Those browsers, which are regularly used by users, will eventually move to the \"trusted\" classification. In the next phase, additional security measures could be put into place and when the new connection is being made from an unknown browser, additional security measures will kick in and protect users. The following sections describe such additional security measures. When the RP detects that a user has started authenticating from a known browser, the RP could withhold the requirement to ask for multiple user identifiers. Good simplification is to only require one identifier, such as the username of the user. After the username is entered on the RP’s website, the RP can lookup the user’s account information from the internal database and then initiate the Smart-ID authentication with the national identity number. However, when the RP detects the user has started an authentication session from an unknown browser, while he usually connects to the website from a different browser, the RP can ask for additional details from the user, to verify that it is indeed the user who is starting the authentication. Such details could be to the national identity number or something else, which the user knows, but the attacker might not know. When the RP detects that a user has started authentication from an unknown browser, while he usually connects to the website from a different browser, the RP can use the longer displayText and send an alert to the user. The alert would be sent in the same authentication session request as usual, but it will be displayed on a separate screen to the user during the authentication consent dialog. The RP could use a message, such as: \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\", or \"It seems that you are not using your regular browser. Are you using a new computer and are you sure that you are on the correct website www.example-rp.com?\" or something similar. The message will be displayed on a separate screen from the usual PIN1 entry dialog and the user will be asked to either confirm or cancel. In case the user is really connecting from a new computer and is aware of this, they can press \"Confirm\". The authentication then proceeds, the user can enter PIN1 and the user’s browser will be logged in to the user’s account. However, if this comes to the user as a surprise and the user is actually using their regular computer, the user can press \"Cancel\" and investigate further. When a user connects to the RP’s e-service, either with a browser or with the RP’s app, it connects from the IP-address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection by itself or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s IP-address. There are commercial services, which provide the general information about IP-addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP-address is known to be used for the following: Sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP-address might be using a compromised computer. Is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP-address might be using a compromised computer or that the attacker is using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website. Is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymising VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website. Is known to be an IP-address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network. This may indicate that the requests coming from such IP-addresses are used to perform denial of service or data mining attack. In addition to such commercial services, the RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP-addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. The following sections describe possible actions to take when there’s suspicion of an attack. RP can use the longer displayText and send an alert to the user. RP could use a message text, such as \"Authentication started from an IP-address with open proxy service. Are you sure that you are on the correct website www.example-rp.com?\", or something similar. The message will be displayed on a separate screen from the usual PIN1 entry and the user will be asked to either confirm or cancel. There could be legitimate reasons why the user is using such IP-address or VPN service and if the user is aware of this, they can press \"Confirm\". However, if this comes to the user as a surprise, the user can press \"Cancel\" and investigate further. In case the source IP-address is used to send many authentication requests and there’s suspicion that a denial of service attack is in progress, RP can perform additional verification on the browser with a CAPTCHA. This can slow down the attackers and forces them to change their scripts and tactics. In case the source IP-address is associated with a previous fraud case and is known to be malicious, the RP can block this connection and deny service. The RP must first record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP-address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to the list of suspicious IP-addresses or malicious IP-addresses; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. When it is known that the RP responds quickly to attacks and attackers are caught by the law enforcement it also acts as a deterrent to future attackers. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organisations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP-addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. For using cookies a cookie consent must be asked from the data subject and the information about using such cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Secure Implementation Guide","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.3","name":"secure","url":"/rp-api/3.1.3/secure.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In RP API v3, new signature protocols for authentication and signing use cases have been introduced in order to maximize the security benefits for each use case: Signature protocol ACSP_V2 - for authentication requests, Signature protocol RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signing requests. The primary reason why different signature protocols are needed is that for signing requests (RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE protocol), the data-to-be-signed object cannot be modified in any way. On the other hand, for authentication requests, the final data-to-be-signed object in ACSP_V2 protocol contains multiple factors, including (but not limited to) a challenge provided by RP (rpChallenge), random factor provided by the server (serverRandom) and a random factor provided by the mobile device (userChallenge). For ACSP_V2 signatureProtocol and signatureProtocolParameters parameters in the authentication requests and examples, see the OpenAPI specification authentication request parameters. Generation of rpChallenge can be done as follows: rpChallenge := BASE64-ENCODE(CRYPTO-RANDOM(64)) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.security.SecureRandom; import java.util.Base64; public class RandomGenerateBase64Encode { public static void main(String[] args) { byte[] rpChallengeBytes = new byte[64]; new SecureRandom().nextBytes(rpChallengeBytes); String rpChallenge = Base64.getEncoder() .encodeToString(rpChallengeBytes); System.out.println(rpChallenge); } } <?php $rpChallengeBytes = random_bytes(64); $rpChallenge = base64_encode($rpChallengeBytes); echo $rpChallenge; ?> import os import base64 rp_challenge_bytes = os.urandom(64) rp_challenge = base64.b64encode(rp_challenge_bytes) print(rp_challenge) package main import ( \"crypto/rand\" \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var rpChallengeBytes []byte = make([]byte, 64) _, err := rand.Read(rpChallengeBytes) if err != nil { fmt.Printf(\"error: %s\\n\", err) return } var rpChallenge []byte = []byte(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(rpChallengeBytes))) fmt.Printf(\"%q\\n\", rpChallenge) } use base64::Engine as _; use rand::RngCore; use rand::rngs::OsRng; fn main() { let mut rp_challenge_bytes: [u8; 64] = [0u8; 64]; OsRng.fill_bytes(&mut rp_challenge_bytes); let rp_challenge_string: String = base64::engine::general_purpose::STANDARD.encode(rp_challenge_bytes); let rp_challenge: &[u8] = rp_challenge_string.as_bytes(); println!(\"{:?}\\n{}\", rp_challenge, rp_challenge_string); } import java.security.SecureRandom import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val random = SecureRandom() val rpChallengeBytes: ByteArray = ByteArray(64) random.nextBytes(rpChallengeBytes) val rpChallenge: String = Base64.getEncoder() .encodeToString(rpChallengeBytes) println(rpChallenge) } using System; public class RandomGenerateBase64Encode { public static void Main(string[] args) { byte[] rpChallengeBytes = new byte[64]; new Random().NextBytes(rpChallengeBytes); string rpChallenge = Convert.ToBase64String(rpChallengeBytes); Console.WriteLine(rpChallenge); } } const crypto = require('crypto'); const rpChallengeBytes = crypto.randomBytes(64); const rpChallenge = rpChallengeBytes.toString('base64'); console.log(rp_challenge); require 'base64' require 'securerandom' rp_challenge_bytes = SecureRandom.random_bytes(64) rp_challenge = Base64.strict_encode64(rp_challenge_bytes) puts rp_challenge For ACSP_V2 signature parameter in the authentication response and examples, see the API spec session status response parameters. To verify the signature.value the RP must first reconstruct its input digest (hash). The digest is calculated over the ACSP_V2_payload, and ACSP_V2_payload is assembled using vertical bar '|' (U+007C) as a separator. Rules of generating the digest value: in case initialCallbackUrl does not exist (for QR and Notification flows), this field must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in case the RP is not acting as a broker, the brokeredRpName must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; interactions must be the same Base64-encoded byte string value that was used to initiate the session. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), trying to encode the same object again might return a different value; the digest must be calculated from UTF-8 encoded byte array that consists of the described elements joined in the specified order with vertical bar '|' (U+007C) as a separator, this also applies to Base64 encoded values, they must be used as is without Base64 decoding; Base64 encoding must also make sure that the unused bits are set to 0 and that the resulting values are correctly padded with = signs; the hash algorithm to use is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters.hashAlgorithm. The signature scheme that was used to generate the signature based on the digest is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm. message := STR-CONCAT( 'smart-id', '|', 'ACSP_V2', '|', serverRandom, '|', rpChallenge, '|', userChallenge, '|', BASE64-ENCODE(relyingPartyName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(brokeredRpName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(SHA-256(interactions)), '|', interactionTypeUsed, '|', initialCallbackUrl, '|', flowType) digest := HASH(UTF8-ENCODE(message)) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

Calculation of the authCode parameter also relies on the assembled device link itself (except for the authCode parameter). This assembled device link without the authCode parameter is referred to as unprotectedDeviceLink. authCodePayload fields The order of the fields in the authCodePayload must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in QR flows, initialCallbackUrl must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in same-device flows (App2App & Web2App), elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink. in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; Encoding Both Base64 and Base64URL encodings are used in the RP API, be careful to use the appropriate encoding as specified. As specified in RFC 4648 Section 5, Base64URL makes the following two substitutions in comparison with the standard Base64 alphabet: + → - and / → _ and as allowed in RFC 4648 Section 3.2 all trailing = characters must be omitted. However, it is recommended to use a standard library function for encoding Base64URL. As the first step, RP assembles authCodePayload using byte concatenation, using the byte representation of vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator: Web2App App2App QR Authentication Session Signature Session Certificate-choice Session For authentication session device links signatureProtocol value is ACSP_V2: authCodePayload := UTF8-ENCODE(STR-CONCAT( 'smart-id', '|', 'ACSP_V2', '|', rpChallenge, '|', BASE64-ENCODE(relyingPartyName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(brokeredRpName), '|', interactions, '|', initialCallbackUrl, '|', unprotectedDeviceLink)) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby public class AuthCodePayload { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String separator = \"|\";

Used as the key in authCode calculation. Must be Base64 decoded before use. schemeName Scheme name is defined by Smart-ID service and it ties the link to the Smart-ID context. The schemeName value depends on the environment. See Environments page for concrete values. signatureProtocol Allowed values: ACSP_V2 - for authentication session, RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signature session, empty - for certificate-choice session. rpChallenge rpChallenge used in the initial authentication request. For more details, see ACSP_V2 signature request parameters. digest digest used in the initial signature request. For more details, see RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters. relyingPartyName relyingPartyName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. brokeredRpName brokeredRpName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. This is only used by those RPs that act as a broker for other RPs. Otherwise must be empty. interactions interactions used in the initial authentication or signature request in Base64 encoded form. Empty for certificate-choice session request. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be reused here in order to guarantee that the values match exactly. initialCallbackUrl Callback URL the Smart-ID app will add parameters to and launch after a successful signature has been given (only in Web2App and App2App flows). Must use HTTPS scheme and there must not be URL fragments (#) in the URL. unprotectedDeviceLink The final URL without the authCode field. Including this in authCode calculation ensures that the link itself can’t be changed by any malicious party. RP API returns sessionSecret in Base64 encoded form.

Added device link based interaction flows (QR code, Web2App, App2App) for authentication, signing, and certificate-choice. Added distinct API endpoints for device link and notification based flows. Example: /v3/authentication/device-link/…​ vs. /v3/authentication/notification/…​ App2App and Web2App device link flows include a mandatory initialCallbackUrl parameter. It is used to construct the final callback URL to which the end-user is redirected after a successful PIN entry. Added new signature protocols: ACSP_V2 (Authentication Context Signing Protocol) RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE (signing pre-computed digests) Added capability to link a device link based certificate-choice request to a subsequent notification based signature request via /v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number}. Added an endpoint /v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} to request signing certificates when document number is know. This means that certificate-choice should only be used now before signature sessions in cases where document number is not know (e.g., no prior Smart-ID authentication). To prevent replay attacks, the mandatory rpChallenge parameter (an RP-generated random value) has been introduced for all initial v3 requests, effectively replacing the nonce parameter used in v2. The RSASSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signature padding scheme has been removed and is replaced by RSASSA-PSS, which is now the only supported option for RSA signatures. This change includes support for SHA-3 hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512) with RSASSA-PSS. Revised Verification Code (VC) generation for notification flows: Authentication flows: VC is derived from rpChallenge. Signing flows: VC is randomly generated by the Smart-ID API server. Introduced a possibility for new verification code formats in the future. For now, the existing format (four numbers) will still be the only option. App2App and Web2App device link flows now require callback verification process as part of the response verification process. The certificatechoice (v2) functionality is now certificate-choice (v3). It has been moved to /v3/signature/certificate-choice/…​. It now also supports device link based flows. The allowedInteractionsOrder parameter has been renamed to interactions, and its value (a JSON array of objects) must now be Base64 encoded. The standalone interaction type verificationCodeChoice has been removed. Use confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice instead for flows that require a verification code choice. The RP API server now provides the device link base URL to RPs. The session status response (GET /session/{sessionID}) now includes userChallenge and flowType. Added interactionTypeUsed to v3 responses. Added new session status end result codes: USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION PROTOCOL_FAILURE SERVER_ERROR API path now uses v2 instead of v1. Example: {rp-api-baseurl}/v2/ instead of {rp-api-baseurl}/v1/. Introduced the concept of \"allowed interactions order\". The allowedInteractionsOrder parameter was added to authentication and signing requests. It replaces the displayText and requestProperties.vcChoice parameters. Added interactionTypeUsed parameter to the session status response message. Added new session status end result codes: REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP USER_REFUSED_DISPLAYTEXTANDPIN USER_REFUSED_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE_WITH_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CERT_CHOICE Added requestProperties parameter for the /v2/certificatechoice API. Includes the new option shareMdClientIpAddress. Removed previously deprecated object reference pno/:country/:national-identity-number. Use etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural instead. RPs must ignore any unknown names (fields) in a JSON response object.","title":"Changes","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.4","name":"changes","url":"/rp-api/3.1.4/changes.html","titles":[{"text":"RP API version 3 changes compared to version 2","hash":"_rp_api_version_3_changes_compared_to_version_2","id":1},{"text":"New features","hash":"_new_features","id":2},{"text":"Security enhancements","hash":"_security_enhancements","id":3},{"text":"API endpoint and parameter changes","hash":"_api_endpoint_and_parameter_changes","id":4},{"text":"RP API version 2 changes compared to version 1","hash":"_rp_api_version_2_changes_compared_to_version_1","id":5}]},"34":{"id":34,"text":"For device link flows that use a callback URL (Web2App and App2App links), the callback URL handling is very important to achieve a secure and phishing-resistant flow. For Web2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP website. RP website backend has to set a session cookie to the user’s browser. This cookie must be set as SameSite=Lax because later, the Smart-ID app will launch the callback URL using top-level navigation and the request type will be GET. RP website backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP website backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL address of RP website and their browser will have the same session cookie. Some aspects to take into account are: User will end up on a new browser tab; The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP website sends the callback URL to RP website backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP website backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session cookie matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. In cases where user initiated the authentication/signing flow on a mobile browser that was not their default browser, the HTTPS callback URL will probably be opened in the default browser which will not have the session cookie and thus the verification must fail. The protocol steps for handling App2App callback URLs are functionally the same as for Web2App; however, there are also some differences in the steps below due to fundamental differences between webpages and apps. For App2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP app. RP app has to save a session identifier in the app’s storage. RP app backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP app backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL, which will cause RP app to open (for this to work, RP app has to be configured to handle that domain and path of the URL). The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP app sends the callback URL together with the session identifier from storage to RP app backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP app backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session identifier matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. If the initial callback URL provided by RP backend is: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ then in the authentication flow the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc&userChallengeVerifier=XtPfaGa8JnGtYrJjboooUf0KfY9sMEHrWFpSQrsUv9c In the signature and certificate-choice flows the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc For both Web2App and App2App callback URLs, the checks described above provide complete phishing resistance. Always prefer device link flows if possible.

ACSP_V2 Version 2 of the ACSP protocol. App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Authentication key pair (or authentication key) Key pair that is used to digitally authenticate a person. Certificate Authority (CA) An entity that issues certificates for Smart-ID account owners. Cross-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in a different device. These use cases are usually used with dynamic QR codes and notification flows. Key pair A Pair of keys that are required for digital signature scheme. There are two kinds of key pairs (or shortly, keys) in the Smart-ID system, authentication key pair and signature key pair. The word pair refers to the private and public keys of each key pair used in an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, here RSA. Mobile device A tablet computer or smartphone that runs a mobile device operating system (Apple iOS, Google Android). Person A natural person who uses the Smart-ID system to authenticate herself to an RP and to issue digital signatures requested by RP. Registration Authority (RA) An entity responsible for recording or verifying some or all of the information (particularly the identities of subjects) needed by a CA to issue certificates and CRLs and to perform other certificate management functions. Relying Party request A request from an RP that requires some kind of operation in the Smart-ID backend system. It may or may not create a transaction. Relying Party (RP) An organization or service, for example a bank, that uses the Smart-ID service to authenticate its users and to get them to sign the documents. Same-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in the same device. Signature key pair (or signature key) Key pair that is used to give digital signatures of a person. Smart-ID account A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID system. Account binds a Smart-ID app instance (installed on a person’s mobile device) to a person’s identity in the Smart-ID system. In the course of account creation and registration, the identity of the account owner (person) is proofed by a Registration Authority (RA) and the relation between the identity and a key pair is certified by a Certificate Authority (CA). An account has a signature key pair and an authentication key pair. Smart-ID app A technical component of the Smart-ID system. A mobile app instance installed on a person’s mobile device that provides access to Smart-ID functionality for persons. Smart-ID provider An organization that is legally responsible for the Smart-ID system. Smart-ID server A technical component of the Smart-ID system. Server-side counterpart of the Smart-ID app. Handles backend operations and provides API-s to Relying Party (RP). Smart-ID system A technical and organizational environment that enables digital authentication and issuing of digital signatures of persons in an electronic environment. The Smart-ID system provides services that allow persons (Smart-ID account owners) to authenticate themselves to RPs, to give digital signatures requested by RPs, and to manage their Smart-ID accounts. Users Natural persons with registered Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. Verification Code (VC) Verification codes are 4 numbers shown to the user for notification based (authentication and signature) flows to let the user bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures.

It consists of the following steps: User interacts with an RP frontend (a webpage or an app). RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a device link based session (authentication, signature, or certificate-choice) to obtain security parameters that are necessary for generating device links. For authentication and certificate-choice sessions, the request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous (signature session can’t be anonymous). RP starts creating device links. In case of QR codes, but not Web2App nor App2App links, the links must be updated each second. The device links must be generated in the RP backend and then forwarded to the RP frontend each time. RP frontend displays QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning the dynamic QR code (preferred option for QR codes); Using a native camera app to scan the dynamic QR code (not supported by all camera apps) which opens the Smart-ID app where user has to scan the QR code again. Clicking on the Web2App link in an RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on the App2App link in an RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and freshness of the device link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. The user is asked to verify the transaction details and enter their PIN. After the signature has been given, the RP receives the result via the session status endpoint. In case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). User is redirected back to the RP with the given callback URL in same-device flows and RP performs the callback URL verification steps described in Callback URLs page. IMPORTANT For device link flows, a single request must be sent. For a single session that displays both a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, multiple requests must not be sent. Some examples: If an RP would like to display a Web2App or App2App link without a dynamic QR code, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started. If an RP would like to display a dynamic QR code without the option for Web2App or App2App links, a device link flow can be started without a callback URL. If an RP would like to display both, a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started (but the callback URL will only be relevant if the user interacts with the Web2App/App2App link, not the QR code). In same-device flow, it may be easier for RP to send a request to session status endpoint only after the callback has been received. This is only relevant when the QR code flow is not provided. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the authentication session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the signature session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the certificateChoice session. When RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a new device link based session, RP API server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique value that is used to connect this authentication/signing attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - Base64 encoded key value that must be kept secret and must not be shared with any other party (including RP frontend); deviceLinkBase - the base URL to be used to generate the QR/Web2App/App2App device links. RP then calculates the Web2App or App2App device link and dynamic QR code and shows it to the end user. The dynamic QR code must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second. It is recommended that RP offers multiple options, QR image and Web2App link, to the user at the same time if either: RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC, The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device, and might want to authenticate using a separate mobile device. NOTE The device link structure is similar for both same-device and cross-device flows. The differences between them are: The value of deviceLinkType is different (Web2App, App2App vs QR), same-device links do not have elapsedSeconds and should not be dynamically regenerated, the final representation of the link to the user is different (a clickable HTTPS link vs a dynamic QR code). IMPORTANT All values in the deviceLink are case-sensitive. The resulting deviceLink must match bit by bit with the expected deviceLink in the Smart-ID backend. There must not be URL encoding in the deviceLink. There must not be URL fragment (#) in the deviceLink. The order of the path parameters in the device link must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; in QR flows, initialCallbackUrl must be included as an empty field; in same-device flows, elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink.

QR code (authentication session) For more details on how the dynamic QR code or other device links should be presented in the RP frontend, see Device link and QR presentation section. The table below explains the parameters that are included in the device link calculation. Parameter Formula version A pre-defined version value, currently 1.0. sessionToken Generated by RP API. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is. deviceLinkType Allowed values: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. sessionType Allowed values: auth - for authentication session, sign - signature session, cert - certificate-choice session. elapsedSeconds Seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. Only used in cross-device flows (dynamic QR code). lang An ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It should match the language that the user was seeing in the RP UI previously. This only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. authCode Calculated using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, using sessionSecret as the key, authCodePayload as the payload, and represented in Base64URL encoding. Explained in a separate page. IMPORTANT The calculation of device links must be performed in the RP backend. All values (including elapsedSeconds) must all be generated in the RP backend and the RP frontend must not be able to change or affect these parameters. For dynamic QR code flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to leak the sessionSecret parameter. Also, it is forbidden to generate values of authCode parameter ahead of time and forward them to the RP frontend/app. version parameter is a pre-defined value. Currently, only 1.0 is supported. It must be used in string form in device links. Example 6. version parameter \"1.0\" RP API returns sessionToken. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 7. sessionToken parameter \"wGIrqveE6AuGDATZKmR1mtAZ\" The parameter deviceLinkType describes the device link type: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 8. deviceLinkType parameter \"QR\" The parameter sessionType describes the session type: auth - for authentication session, sign - for signature session, cert - for certificate-choice session. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 9. sessionType parameter \"auth\" The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial session creation request to RP API. Notice that dynamic QR code link must be re-calculated each second because the elapsedSeconds value changes. elapsedSeconds value must be converted to string value to be used in QR code links: elapsedSeconds := TO-STRING(elapsedSeconds) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby public class Int2Str { public static void main(String[] args) { int elapsedSeconds = 22; String elapsedSecondsStr = Integer.toString(elapsedSeconds); System.out.println(elapsedSecondsStr); } } <?php $elapsedSeconds = 22; $elapsedSecondsStr = strval($elapsedSeconds); echo $elapsedSecondsStr; ?> elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = str(elapsed_seconds) print(elapsed_seconds_str) package main import ( \"fmt\" \"strconv\" ) func main() { var elapsedSeconds int = 22 var elapsedSecondsStr string = strconv.Itoa(elapsedSeconds) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", elapsedSecondsStr) } fn main() { let elapsed_seconds: i32 = 22; let elapsed_seconds_str: String = elapsed_seconds.to_string(); println!(\"{}\", elapsed_seconds_str) } fun main() { val elapsedSeconds: Int = 22 val elapsedSecondsStr: String = elapsedSeconds.toString() println(elapsedSecondsStr) } using System; public class Int2Str { public static void Main() { int elapsedSeconds = 22; string elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.ToString(); Console.WriteLine(elapsedSecondsStr); } } let elapsedSeconds = 22; let elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.toString(); console.log(elapsedSecondsStr); elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = elapsed_seconds.to_s puts elapsed_seconds_str Example 10. elapsedSeconds parameter \"22\" The lang parameter defines the interface language for the HTTPS fallback page that is shown to the user when there are technical problems regarding opening device links (for example, if user’s browser does not support Web2App links and needs to be configured to allow them or if Smart-ID app is not installed on the phone). Its format must be ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It is recommended that for consistent user experience, RP provides here the same language that the user was already using in the RP UI. This parameter only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. Example 11. lang parameter \"eng\" authCode parameter generation is explained in detail in authCode calculation page. The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters involved in device link construction should be accessible by which parties (see legend below). The table also includes parameters which are used for authCode calculation (e.g. unprotectedDeviceLink) — for their descriptions, see authCode calculation page. RP API server RP backend RP frontend/app version sessionID sessionToken sessionSecret deviceLinkType sessionType signatureProtocol rpChallenge digest relyingPartyName brokeredRpName interactions initialCallbackUrl unprotectedDeviceLink elapsedSeconds authCode lang Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - does not know parameter - MUST NOT know parameter For cases when the app is not installed or some other problem occurs with opening a device link, a fallback HTTPS webpage is opened with instructions on how to resolve the issue. The lang parameter in the link is by default used to show the same language as on the RP UI. The instructions cover the following scenarios: User is not on a mobile device where Smart-ID app is installed and has been allowed by the RP to use a wrong type of device link (e.g. a same-device link on a PC). Smart-ID App is not installed on the current device. Mobile browser does not support universal links / Android App links. Mobile OS/browser settings disallow the link and user intervention is required. For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW or MEDIUM should be used. HIGH cannot be used due to the typical device link length. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal block size for QR code is 6-10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues, although many will not). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning and take up too much space. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. QR code can be generated on the client or server. It is recommended to use the SVG format as it remains sharp when users zoom the page. Note that many QR code libraries that support SVG output do not accept block size as an input parameter. So, block size should be estimated based on overall image dimensions, device link length and error correction level. See QR generator section for an example which also calculates the resulting block size in pixels. IMPORTANT The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, however the link itself must only be generated by the RP backend. This is because sensitive parameters such as sessionSecret must never be sent to the RP frontend. This form allows you to test different QR code sizes with the recommended parameters and estimate the block size in pixels.

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases, i.e. authentication and signing. The main Smart-ID use case is of a Relying Party (RP) starting a session by calling the Smart-ID service RP API with a challenge when the user wishes to authenticate with the Relying Party’s service or a hash to create a digital signature. Depending on the chosen RP API endpoint, either the user scans a dynamic QR code or (in the same-device use case) the user clicks a link that launches the Smart-ID application, or the Smart-ID server sends a push notification to the application. The user then verifies the details of the transaction displayed by the Smart-ID application and confirms it. The Smart-ID application communicates with the Smart-ID server to generate the digital signature which makes it available for the Relying Party to be fetched. Meanwhile, the Relying Party has been waiting for a reply from the Smart-ID server using a long poll connection. In the case of success, it receives the signature and the user’s certificate to validate the result. The service creates digital signatures as proof of authentication and signing. However, to create electronic signatures (ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES signatures or PDF with PAdES signatures) the Relying Party must create the required document structure themselves, calculate the hash and have that signed using this API. The latest version of the API introduces new flows collectively referred to as \"device link flows\". For cross-device use cases — dynamic QR codes that the user must scan; for same-device use cases where the user is visiting an RP webpage using a mobile browser — device links which the user must click; for same-device use cases where the user is using an RP app — device links which the user must click. The guiding principle in designing the API has been to unify the three aforementioned flows as much as possible to minimize the integration efforts for RPs. Because of this, they mostly share the same security mechanisms and principles, even though the methods used to launch the Smart-ID application are completely different. This also means it is possible for an RP to offer multiple alternative methods of authentication at the same time without making multiple requests to the RP API. In the latest RP API version 3, the notification based flows will still be available, but for maximum security, it is recommended they are only used if the particular user has been authenticated at least once before on the device by one of the more secure device link flows. This can be accomplished by utilizing the client device’s local storage (e.g. browser cookies, local app storage). Device link based flows must always be used in the same-device use case for both usability and security reasons. Brokers of the Smart-ID service are treated similarly to Relying Parties (RPs) and there is no extra configuration compared to previous RP API versions. Although Smart-ID service is a secure technology designed with security in mind, Relying Parties (RPs) need to consider potential risks which are associated with digital authentication and signing solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users understand the context of their actions and protect them from possible attacks. For example, there might be a malicious phishing website controlled by attacker between user’s browser and the RP’s website. Throughout this integration guide, we describe effective security measures for mitigating attacks, however not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the RP’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Throughout this document, there will be blocks of text as shown below. IMPORTANT Important blocks like these must be followed by every RP without exceptions. These blocks show important points of the API which might lead to security issues or failures if implemented wrongly. NOTE Blocks that look like this present additional information and optional features. TIP Blocks that look like this link to other related sections in the guide.

All messages are encoded using UTF-8. All requests only support HTTP/1.1, as described in RFC 2616. Normally, all positive responses are returned with HTTP status code 200. In some cases, 400 series error codes are used, those cases are described per request. All 500 series error codes indicate some kind of fatal server error. Smart-ID RP API returns different error codes for different error cases. However, to prevent data mining the RPs must not show different UI messages for those cases and make enumeration attacks more difficult. In cases where the user does not have an account, HTTP status code 404 is returned by the RP API. This could be caused by the user entering wrong ID code. It is recommended that RPs verify the user ID code checksums when possible to catch these errors. Whenever an RP session creation request (POST to signature/certificate-choice/ or signature/) is repeated inside a 15-second timeframe with exactly the same parameters, session ID of an existing session can be returned as a result. This allows to retry RP POST requests in case of communication errors. When the caller wants, it can override the idempotent behaviour inside this timeframe using an optional nonce parameter present for signature/certificate-choice and signature POST requests. Normally, that parameter can be omitted. IMPORTANT Providing nonce parameter is not allowed for authentication requests, since each authentication request must provide a randomly generated value for rpChallenge, making each authentication request already unique. RP API clients are authenticated based on their originating IP-address and relyingPartyUUID protocol parameter combinations. When authentication fails, server responds with HTTP error 401. relyingPartyName request field is case-insensitive and must match one of the names configured for the calling RP. The names are UTF-8 encoded and are displayed to the user in the Smart-ID application. The Smart-ID service reserves the right to add new fields into responses of the current RP API version. Therefore, the RP must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response objects at any location within the JSON structure. It is essential that RP client performs all the required checks when connecting to the Smart-ID RP API HTTPS endpoint, to make sure that the connection endpoint is authentic and that the connection is secure. This is required to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for the authentication and signature protocols. The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS cipher suite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint is valid (not expired, signed by trusted CA and not revoked). In case the RP fails to verify the connection is genuine and secure an attacker might be able to launch a MITM attack on the connection and either login as the user or have the user sign a forged document.","title":"API technical description","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.4","name":"api_details","url":"/rp-api/3.1.4/api_details.html","titles":[{"text":"HTTP status codes","hash":"_http_status_codes","id":1},{"text":"Error responses","hash":"_error_responses","id":2},{"text":"Idempotent behaviour","hash":"_idempotent_behaviour","id":3},{"text":"Interface authentication","hash":"_interface_authentication","id":4},{"text":"API client must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response object","hash":"_api_client_must_ignore_unknown_names_fields_in_json_response_object","id":5},{"text":"RP API endpoint authentication","hash":"_rp_api_endpoint_authentication","id":6}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"After receiving the transaction response from the session status API call the following algorithm must be used to decide if the authentication result is trustworthy and what the identity of the authenticating end user is, if the signature result is valid. In App2App and Web2App flows, the response verification step must be performed after the user has returned via the callback URL, as described in Callback URLs page. The following steps perform the response verification algorithm. Note that the algorithm is applicable to both authentication and signature session flows. Specific differences, such as the conditional execution of Steps 1 and 3, are noted within the steps. Session secret verification (applicable only for sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Base64 decode the sessionSecret string received in the initial request. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the Base64 decoded sessionSecret value. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Obtain the sessionSecretDigest value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the sessionSecretDigest obtained from the callback URL. Initial session response check: Verify the state field in the JSON response is exactly COMPLETE. Verify the result.endResult field is exactly OK. Verify the signatureProtocol field is exactly ACSP_V2 in case of authentication or RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE in case of signature. Ensure the cert, signature, and result objects are present and not null. User challenge verification (applicable only for authentication sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Obtain the userChallengeVerifier value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the received userChallengeVerifier string. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the signature.userChallenge string provided in the JSON response’s signature object. Certificate Chain Validation and Trust: Decode the Base64 encoded end-entity certificate string from cert.value and parse it into a standard X.509 certificate representation. The RP API provides only the end-entity certificate, the Relying Party must have the necessary root and intermediate CA certificates configured locally to allow the library to build the full certificate chain. For these certificates, see Certificates page. Using a standard cryptographic library, initiate the validation of the certificate chain starting from the end-entity certificate. Provide the end-entity certificate to the library, along with configuring it with the set of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors). It’s important to note that some libraries use the system certificate store in addition to the provided CA certificates, this should be disabled and only the explicitly configured CA certificates should be used. For each certificate in the constructed chain (end-entity certificate and all intermediate CA certificates), perform the following checks. A standard cryptographic library will typically perform the following checks as part of its overall chain validation routine and report the result as a success or failure. Verify the certificate’s digital signature using the public key of its issuer certificate. Verify the certificate’s validity period against the current time, i.e., not before the notBefore date and not after the notAfter date. Verify that the certificate has not been revoked. This check should be performed using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), utilizing the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension within the certificate to locate the OCSP responder URL. If OCSP fails or is unavailable, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking should be used as fallback. Note: Revocation checks (OCSP/CRL) are not performed on self-signed root CA certificates configured as trust anchors. Intermediate CA certificates can be revoked and must be checked. Note: OCSP responses are digitally signed. The certificate chain of the OCSP responder itself should also be verified, ensuring it is trusted and authorized to provide status for the certificate being checked. Verify basic constraints are appropriate: Intermediate CA certificates must have the Basic Constraints extension present with the cA boolean set to TRUE. For end-entity certificates, the Basic Constraints extension should either absent, or if present, its cA boolean should be set to FALSE. Smart-ID Scheme Identification (End-Entity Certificate): Before checking specific purposes, verify that the end-entity certificate belongs to the Smart-ID scheme. Examine the Certificate Policies extension of the end-entity certificate. The certificate must contain all the specific policy OIDs designated by SK ID Solutions for the Smart-ID scheme (as defined in Chapter 2.2.3 of the \"Smart-ID Certificate and OCSP Profile\" in Certificate Profiles page). These OIDs differentiate Smart-ID certificates from other types of certificates (e.g., Mobile-ID, Estonian ID-card). The Relying Party must consult the current official SK ID Solutions Certificate Policies for the definitive list of Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs. For these certificate policies, see Certificate Policies page. If not all the recognized Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs are present, the certificate should not be processed as a Smart-ID certificate, and the verification should fail for this context. End-Entity Certificate Purpose Validation (Smart-ID Context): Examine the end-entity certificate for extensions and attributes required by the certificate profile. For these certificate profiles, see Certificate Profiles page. For Smart-ID authentication: To confirm the certificate is suitable for authentication, it must contain one of the following: The digitalSignature key usage and the Smart-ID authentication (1.3.6.1.4.1.62306.5.7.0) Extended Key Usage which is present in certificates issued April 2025 onwards. The digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment key usages and the id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) Extended Key Usage which is found in older, still valid certificates issued before April 2025. For digital signing: Check for appropriate key usage nonRepudiation. Assurance Level Check: Extract the assurance level string from cert.certificateLevel (e.g., ADVANCED, QUALIFIED). For qualified certificates, check that the extension values as defined by the certificate profile exist within the certificate from cert.value. Compare this level against the minimum assurance level required by the RP for the specific context or transaction. Ensure the certificate’s level meets or exceeds the required level (note that ADVANCED < QUALIFIED). Identity Match Check: Extract the authenticated user’s identifier from the end-entity certificate. For Smart-ID certificates serialNumber (OID 2.5.4.5) under Subject DN contain the national identity code, for example PNOEE-30001010004. If the RP initiated the authentication or signing for a specific known user, verify that the extracted identifier matches the expected identity for that session. Verification of signature Object (authentication/signature session): Only for authentication session: Reconstruct the exact ACSP_V2_payload string that was signed, as described under ACSP_V2 digest calculation. This is done by concatenating the fields in order, separated by the vertical bar character | (U+007C): 'smart-id'|'ACSP_V2'|serverRandom|rpChallenge|userChallenge|BASE64(relyingPartyName)|BASE64(brokeredRpName)|BASE64(SHA-256(interactions))|interactionTypeUsed|initialCallbackUrl|flowType Only for signature session: Use the data-to-be-signed, a digest of which was initially sent when initiating the signature session (as described in RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol). Decode the signature value from signature.value using Base64 decoding. Obtain the public key from the parsed end-entity user certificate (from Step 4). Only for authentication session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against the UTF-8 bytes of the reconstructed ACSP_V2_payload string. Only for signature session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against either the data-to-be-signed or the hash of the data-to-be-signed (there are libraries that provide options for either). Ensure the verification uses the algorithm specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm (e.g., rsassa-pss) and correctly applies the parameters from signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters (e.g., hash algorithm like SHA-512, MGF1 hash like SHA-512, salt length like 64, and the trailer field 0xbc). Session Management (Only for authentication sessions. Important: only perform if all the preceding steps (1-9) were successful): Invalidate any previous, unauthenticated session identifier associated with the user’s interaction (e.g., browser cookie or API token used before successful authentication). Generate a new, secure, and unique session identifier representing the now authenticated state. Associate the authenticated user’s identity (from Step 8) and potentially the assurance level (from Step 7) with this new session identifier in your server-side session store. After a successful action, the users should be able to view their actions or download the signed document.

In RP API v3, new signature protocols for authentication and signing use cases have been introduced in order to maximize the security benefits for each use case: Signature protocol ACSP_V2 - for authentication requests, Signature protocol RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signing requests. Authentication Context Signature Protocol (ACSP) is a protocol that is used for authentication requests. In ACSP_v2, the final data-to-be-signed object incorporates multiple factors such as a challenge from the Relying Party (rpChallenge), a server-provided random factor (serverRandom), and a random factor from the user’s mobile device (userChallenge).

The digest is calculated over the ACSP_V2_payload, and ACSP_V2_payload is assembled using vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator. Rules of generating the digest value: in case initialCallbackUrl does not exist (for QR and Notification flows), this field must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in case the RP is not acting as a broker, the brokeredRpName must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; interactions must be the same Base64-encoded byte string value that was used to initiate the session. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), trying to encode the same object again might return a different value; the digest must be calculated from UTF-8 encoded byte array that consists of the described elements joined in the specified order with vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator, this also applies to Base64 encoded values, they must be used as is without Base64 decoding; Base64 encoding must also make sure that the unused bits are set to 0 and that the resulting values are correctly padded with = signs; the hash algorithm to use is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters.hashAlgorithm. The signature scheme that was used to generate the signature based on the digest is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm. message := STR-CONCAT( 'smart-id', '|', 'ACSP_V2', '|', serverRandom, '|', rpChallenge, '|', userChallenge, '|', BASE64-ENCODE(relyingPartyName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(brokeredRpName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(SHA-256(interactions)), '|', interactionTypeUsed, '|', initialCallbackUrl, '|', flowType) digest := HASH(UTF8-ENCODE(message)) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE is a signature protocol where a pre-calculated digest (hash) of the data-to-be-signed is sent in the initial request, and the digital signature is generated directly on this provided digest. For verification, the digest itself or the complete original data that corresponds to the digest must be used. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signatureProtocol and signatureProtocolParameters parameters in the signature requests and examples, see the API spec signature request parameters. The digest value sent with the initial RP request is the digest value of the data-to-be-signed. One of the supported hash algorithms must be used. The signature is directly generated on the digest value and the verification must be done using the data-to-be-signed. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature parameter in the signature response and examples, see the API spec session status response parameters. Full verification of the signature and response is described in Response verification.","title":"Signature protocols","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.4","name":"signature_protocols","url":"/rp-api/3.1.4/signature_protocols.html","titles":[{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature protocol","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_protocol","id":1},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature request parameters","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_request_parameters","id":2},{"text":"rpChallenge generation","hash":"_rpchallenge_generation","id":3},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature response parameters","hash":"_acsp_v2_signature_response_parameters","id":4},{"text":"ACSP_V2 digest calculation","hash":"acsp_v2_digest_calculation","id":5},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol","hash":"raw_digest_signature_protocol","id":6},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters","hash":"raw_digest_signature_request_parameters","id":7},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE digest value","hash":"raw_digest_signature_digest_calculation","id":8},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature response parameters","hash":"_raw_digest_signature_signature_response_parameters","id":9}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"The Relying Party API provides five different types of endpoints. The first four are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fifth is a GET request used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The POST v3/authentication/* session endpoints are used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the POST v3/signature/* session endpoints are used to create digital signatures; the POST v3/signature/certificate-choice/* session endpoints are used when the document number is not known immediately prior to the signature session and the user’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; the POST v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} endpoint is used to obtain the signing certificate of the requested document number; finally, the GET v3/session/{sessionID} status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. The implementation details are described on the OpenAPI specification page. There are two types of flows that can be used in v3/authentication/*, v3/signature/* and v3/signature/certificate-choice/* sessions - the device link based flow and the notification based flow. NOTE In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only use device link based flows or only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a device link based flow beforehand. It is up to the RP to decide how to securely identify such devices/browsers and tie them to the Smart-ID document-number by utilizing browser cookies, local app storage or other means. For more details on additional security measures RPs can deploy, see the additional security measures page. There are different ways to reference users - via their issued identifier, a document number linking a specific account or even not at all (in case of device link based flows). The different object references are described on the OpenAPI specification page. IMPORTANT Once a user has been identified within the RP session, then in subsequent signing, certificate-choice and re-authentication session requests the document number reference should be used. The main use cases and which sessions and flows to use are described below. Utilizing the RP API as described below provides the best user experience and security. In the URL examples below and other pages BASE refers to the RP API base address https://rp-api.smart-id.com The following diagram shows main authentication flows and which endpoints to use. The following diagram shows main signature flows and which endpoints to use. Use case: The RP session is on a separate device from the mobile phone where the Smart-ID app is installed. For example, the user is using a PC browser to access an RP website or a tablet to access an RP application. Use case: The RP frontend (whether an RP app or website accessed by a mobile browser) resides on the same mobile device as the Smart-ID app. The end user is using a mobile app or RP detects that the user is on a mobile browser so it can be assumed that the user intends to use the Smart-ID app on a same device. Strongly prefer the BASE/v3/*/device-link/anonymous endpoints for same-device use cases unless the user’s document-number has already been established for the current session. These endpoints provide a superior user experience as no user identifier entry is required while the device-links with callbacks provide the best security protections. However, a fallback option should also be provided to switch to the cross-device use cases. Using the device link based flow is the most secure option and should be preferred. RP may call the anonymous device link based authentication session endpoint and display a dynamic QR code that the user must scan with the Smart-ID app or show a same-device (Web2App, App2App) link the user can interact with. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/anonymous Instead of using the anonymous authentication session endpoint, the RP may request the user to enter their user identifier and utilize the non-anonymous authentication session endpoint. This may be beneficial when the RP utilizes custom usernames and has the users' identifiers stored internally. The RP may simply always ask the user for the identifier as well. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint should be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/document/{document-number} Notification based authentication session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. Using a notification based authentication session endpoint triggers a push notification to all the user’s devices instead of the user scanning the QR code or clicking the same-device link. BASE/v3/authentication/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint can be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/notification/document/{document-number} If a user has already logged onto the RP app or website using Smart-ID authentication, the RP can call the certificate session endpoint to obtain the user’s signing certificate. As the document number is attained from the preceding authentication call, no user interaction is required for the certificate-choice session and the RP API can immediately provide the certificate. BASE/v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} The RP can then call the device link based signature session endpoint to sign using the same Smart-ID account that was used for authentication. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/document/{document-number} The notification based signature session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} If possible, the Smart-ID authentication should be performed before signing and (and after that is completed, instructions in Signing with prior Smart-ID authentication should be followed). In case no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, and certificate is required, the anonymous device link based certificate-choice session endpoint should be used. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/device-link/anonymous Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must call the notification based linked signature session endpoint and provide the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter (session ID of the previous certificate-choice session) to connect the signature and certificate-choice sessions. BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number} The combination of device link based certificate-choice and notification based linked signature session endpoints provides the optimal user experience where Smart-ID app is launched only once and a verification code (VC) is not shown. If the certificate-choice session was completed using a same-device device link, after the flow is completed, the Smart-ID app will launch the callbackUrl given in the device link based certificate-choice. NOTE In the flow described above, it is recommended to stop showing the QR code, Web2App or App2App link in the RP UI after the certificate is obtained. If the certificate is not required, or is already known, the device link based signature session endpoint should be called instead. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} NOTE There is no anonymous device link based signature session endpoint, since in all practical signing use cases the user’s identity is known beforehand. Notification based certificate-choice session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose but is not recommended. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must display the VC and call notification based signature session endpoint. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} IMPORTANT Notification based certificate-choice cannot be connected to notification based linked signature session endpoint with linkedSessionID. If notification based certificate-choice is used, verification code (VC) must still be shown to the user, and in same-device use cases, there might be usability issues with VC being shown too fast or not being shown at all (this is especially problematic for interactions involving confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice).","title":"Overview","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.4","name":"overview","url":"/rp-api/3.1.4/overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Cross-device use cases","hash":"cross_device_use_cases","id":1},{"text":"Same-device use cases","hash":"same_device_use_cases","id":2},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":3},{"text":"Notification based authentication","hash":"_notification_based_authentication","id":4},{"text":"Signing","hash":"_signing","id":5},{"text":"Signing with prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"signing_with_prior_authentication","id":6},{"text":"Notification based signing with prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_with_prior_smart_id_authentication","id":7},{"text":"Signing without prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"_signing_without_prior_smart_id_authentication","id":8},{"text":"Notification based signing without prior Smart-ID authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_without_prior_smart_id_authentication","id":9}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"Smart-ID app can support different interaction types and a Relying Party (RP) can demand a particular interaction with or without a fallback possibility. Different interactions can support different amount of data to display information to user. Each interaction is defined by an object that has 2 parameters: type and either displayText60 or displayText200. The following table shows interaction types available for each flow type. Linked notification based flow refers to the BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint. Interaction type & extra parameter Description Device link based flows Notification based flows Linked notification based flow displayTextAndPIN with displayText60 The simplest interaction with max 60 chars of text and PIN entry on a single screen. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessage with displayText200 First screen is for text only (max 200 chars) and has Confirm and Cancel buttons. Second screen is for PIN. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice with displayText200 First screen combines text and Verification Code choice. Second screen is for PIN. No Yes No All three interactions types are currently supported by all the clients. RP uses interactions parameter to list interactions it allows for the current session. New interaction types may be introduced in the future. However, it takes some time until all apps have been updated and are actually capable of displaying the new types. After introduction of a new interaction type both the new interaction type as a well as an older type should be provided in the array for clients that have not been yet updated. The interactions parameter is a Base64 encoded JSON array and the order of the items is significant. Each interaction in the array is a JSON object consisting of the type, and either displayText60 or displayText200. The first interaction that is supported by a specific app installation will be used. The interaction that was used is always reported back to RP with interactionTypeUsed response parameter to the session request. If an app cannot support any interaction requested then the session is cancelled with reason code REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP. IMPORTANT The following requirements apply for the interaction object: For each interaction, the type and the corresponding displayText (either displayText60 or displayText200) parameters are mandatory. Meaning that each interaction must include a non-empty displayText60 or displayText200 parameter. It is forbidden to provide both displayText60 and displayText200 parameters. It is not allowed to have more than one interaction with the same type value. In addition, it is not allowed to list interaction types not meant for the flow (device link flow or notification based flow). JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional). Therefore, the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be stored and reused in all subsequent calculations. This is relevant for all device link flows, more specifically in: authCode calculation; ACSP_V2 digest calculation (authentication only) during response verification. Failing to meet the first 4 requirements above will result in an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request). Failing to follow the last recommendation can result in some dynamic link sessions failing. If authCode calculation returns a different value from what RP API calculates, then the device link will be rejected due to wrong authCode value. If ACSP_V2 digest is calculated incorrectly, a valid user authentication signature will appear to be invalid and RP will have to deny the authentication attempt. displayText is a short text string displayed to the user in the Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent screen. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Smart-ID to authenticate users calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use a different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. displayText value can only be set by the RP backend and phishing attacks can’t change it. This is why, it is recommended to use the displayText to alert users and show warnings if an attack is suspected. For more details, see Additional security measures page. The displayText60 and displayText200 parameters are used by the Smart-ID app to display text on the screen. The preferred way of writing displayText60 and displayText200 is to explain the action user is taking which the user is expected to confirm. The descriptions should be concise and specific allowing the user to verify the context of the operation quickly. A few examples: Logging in to internet banking Log in to mobile banking app Applying for a credit card application, 1000€ credit limit Signing document Contract.asice Transfer 1000€ to Jane Doe GB33BUKB20201555555555 Usually, the Relying Party name does not need to be part of the display text as the RP name parameter is always displayed to the user along with the display text. Before sending the RP API request, interactions array must be turned into a string and then Base64 encoded. The interactions JSON should be minified to lower the overhead. The Base64 encoding can be done as follows: interactions := BASE64-ENCODE(TO-STRING(MINIFY(interactionsJson))) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

To force the user to perform the verification, the RP can request the Smart-ID app to display three VCs (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code which is displayed by the RP website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice interaction type. For details of the interactions object, see Interactions page. NOTE In case of same-device use cases where the recommended App2App or Web2App device link flow cannot be used for some reason, then in notification flows it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app before the push notification arrives. Below, sequence diagrams are given along with explanations of the differences. The following diagram describes the notification based flow for the authentication session. The following sequence diagram illustrates the notification based signing flow. The following sequence diagram illustrates the device link based certificate choice flow being linked to a notification based signing flow. There are separate signing protocols for authentication and signature requests (see signature protocols for details). In RP API v3 notification based authentication requests, RP must compute verification codes (VC) for each authentication request, so the user can bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. The VC is computed as follows: Calculate SHA-256 from the rpChallenge, extract 2 rightmost bytes from the result, interpret them as a big-endian unsigned integer and take the last 4 digits in decimal form for display. SHA-256 must be used to calculate the VC. Please keep in mind that the rpChallenge is the real rpChallenge byte value (for example, the byte array returned from the SecureRandom() or equivalent method), not the Base64 encoded form used for transport or the popular hexadecimal representation. The VC value must be displayed to the user in the browser together with a message asking the end user to verify the code matches with the one displayed on their mobile device. The user must not proceed if these don’t match. integer(SHA-256(rpChallenge)[-2:-1]) mod 10000 Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.math.BigInteger; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.security.MessageDigest; import java.util.Base64; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode( rpChallengeBase64 ); MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); md.update(rpChallengeBytes); byte[] sha256Hash = md.digest(); BigInteger LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK = new BigInteger(\"65535\"); BigInteger result = new BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(new BigInteger(\"10000\")); String verificationCode = String.format(\"%04d\", result); System.out.println(verificationCode); } } <?php $rpChallengeBase64 = base64_decode('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg=='); $sha256Hash = hash('sha256', $rpChallengeBase64, true); $result = hexdec(bin2hex(substr($sha256Hash, -2))) % 10000; $verificationCode = sprintf('%04d', $result); echo $verificationCode; ?> import base64 import hashlib rp_challenge_base64 = b\"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" rp_challenge_bytes = base64.b64decode(rp_challenge_base64) sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(rp_challenge_bytes).digest() result = int.from_bytes(sha256_hash[-2:], byteorder='big') % 10000 verification_code = f\"{result:04d}\" print(verification_code) package main import ( \"crypto/sha256\" \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var rpChallengeBase64 string = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" var rpChallengeBytes, err = base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(rpChallengeBase64) if err != nil { panic(err) } var sha256Hash [32]byte = sha256.Sum256(rpChallengeBytes) var result int = int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-2])<<8 + int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-1]) result %= 10000 var verificationCode string = fmt.Sprintf(\"%04d\", result) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\",verificationCode) } use base64::decode; use sha2::{Sha256, Digest}; fn main() { let rp_challenge_base64: &str = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; let rp_challenge_bytes = decode(rp_challenge_base64).unwrap(); let sha256_hash = Sha256::digest(&rp_challenge_bytes); let result = (((sha256_hash[30] as u16) << 8) + (sha256_hash[31] as u16)) % 10000; let verification_code: String = format!(\"{:04}\", result); println!(\"{}\", verification_code); } import java.math.BigInteger import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets import java.security.MessageDigest import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val rpChallengeBase64: String = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" val rpChallengeBytes: ByteArray = Base64.getDecoder().decode(rpChallengeBase64) val sha256Hash: ByteArray = MessageDigest .getInstance(\"SHA-256\") .digest(rpChallengeBytes) val LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK: BigInteger = BigInteger(\"65535\") val result: BigInteger = BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(BigInteger(\"10000\")) val verificationCode = \"%04d\".format(result) println(verificationCode) } using System; using System.Security.Cryptography; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void Main(string[] args) { string rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(rpChallengeBase64); using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create()) { byte[] sha256Hash = sha256.ComputeHash(rpChallengeBytes); int result = ((sha256Hash[30] << 8) + (sha256Hash[31])) % 10000; string verificationCode = result.ToString(\"D4\"); Console.WriteLine(verificationCode); } } } const crypto = require('crypto'); const rpChallenge = Buffer.from('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==', 'base64'); const sha256 = crypto.createHash('sha256'); sha256.update(rpChallenge); const sha256Hash = sha256.digest(); const result = sha256Hash.readUInt16BE(30) % 10000 .toString() .padStart(4, '0'); console.log(result); require 'base64' require 'digest' rp_challenge = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" sha256_hash = Digest::SHA256.digest(Base64.decode64(rp_challenge)) last_2_bytes = sha256_hash[-2..-1].unpack('n*').first result = (last_2_bytes % 10_000).to_s.rjust(4, '0') puts result Example 1.

Commonly Smart-ID is used together with national identity numbers, however these national identity numbers might not be secret and could be enumerated. A better approach is to use anonymous device links which require the user to initiate the authentication process. If the anonymous device links can’t be used for some reason, then the RP may ask for national identity number and a non-public identifier as well. This non-public identifier can be a username the users can choose, the account contract number or something else only the user knows. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whenever the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to log in from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter, an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. IMPORTANT Using the User-Agent field for device/browser identification is not secure and should be avoided as it can be easily spoofed by a malicious party. The following are recommendations for setting up tracking for trusted and unknown browsers: The tracking must be done with an HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage features supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier (trackingID). The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The RP database must keep previously seen browsers with the randomly generated identifier hash (hashedTrackingID), and the RP may allow the user to edit the names of the known browsers. The browser cookie must be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags, and the scope of the cookie must be the URL of the RP’s website. The RP website or app must allow the user to invalidate all the cookies on the RP server. A simple algorithm to set the hashedTrackingID for the user and browser combination can be used: If a valid trackingID is not present, and authentication succeeds, set the trackingID and save it in the database for the particular user and browser combination. If a valid trackingID for the particular user and browser combination is present, the browser can be trusted. Additional security measures can be used if a new connection from an unknown browser is made, such as: asking for the user’s national identity number, sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\". When a user connects to the RP’s website or the app, it connects from the IP address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s or proxy’s IP address. There are commercial services that can provide general information about IP addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP address is known to be used for: sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer, is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate that the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer or that an attacker might be using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymizing VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be an IP address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network, which may indicate that the requests might be used to perform denial-of-service or data mining attacks. In addition to such commercial services, RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. Additional security measures can be used if the IP address is determined to be suspicious, such as: sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from a suspicious IP address. Are you authenticating to https://rp.example.com?\", performing a CAPTCHA verification, block connections from malicious IP addresses. It is important to give the user an option to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on their account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognize and that could point to security incidents. RPs must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. RP should record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website or app. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty that: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to a blocklist; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organizations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. Preferences cookies which are mentioned above for tracking trusted and unknown browsers require users' consent, and the information about using the cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data, the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Additional security measures","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.4","name":"additional_security_measures","url":"/rp-api/3.1.4/additional_security_measures.html","titles":[{"text":"Anonymous flows and user identifiers","hash":"_anonymous_flows_and_user_identifiers","id":1},{"text":"Keeping track of trusted and unknown browsers","hash":"_keeping_track_of_trusted_and_unknown_browsers","id":2},{"text":"Keeping track of suspicious and malicious IP addresses","hash":"_keeping_track_of_suspicious_and_malicious_ip_addresses","id":3},{"text":"Allowing users to verify operations","hash":"allowing-users-to-verify-operations","id":4},{"text":"Monitoring usage patterns","hash":"_monitoring_usage_patterns","id":5},{"text":"Responding to security incidents","hash":"_responding_to_security_incidents","id":6},{"text":"Personal data processing","hash":"_personal_data_processing","id":7}]},"46":{"id":46,"text":"Relying Party API is exposed over a REST interface. All messages are encoded using UTF-8. All requests only support HTTP/1.1, as described in RFC 2616. Normally, all positive responses are returned with HTTP status code 200. In some cases, 400 series error codes are used, those cases are described per request. All 500 series error codes indicate some kind of fatal server error. Smart-ID RP API returns different error codes for different error cases. However, to prevent data mining the RPs must not show different UI messages for those cases and make enumeration attacks more difficult. In cases where the user does not have an account, HTTP status code 404 is returned by the RP API. This could be caused by the user entering wrong ID code. It is recommended that RPs verify the user ID code checksums when possible to catch these errors. Whenever an RP session creation request (POST to signature/certificate-choice/ or signature/) is repeated inside a 15-second timeframe with exactly the same parameters, session ID of an existing session can be returned as a result. This allows to retry RP POST requests in case of communication errors. When the caller wants, it can override the idempotent behaviour inside this timeframe using an optional nonce parameter present for signature/certificate-choice and signature POST requests. Normally, that parameter can be omitted. IMPORTANT Providing nonce parameter is not allowed for authentication requests, since each authentication request must provide a randomly generated value for rpChallenge, making each authentication request already unique. RP API clients are authenticated based on their originating IP-address and relyingPartyUUID protocol parameter combinations. When authentication fails, server responds with HTTP error 401. relyingPartyName request field is case-insensitive and must match one of the names configured for the calling RP. The names are UTF-8 encoded and are displayed to the user in the Smart-ID application. The Smart-ID service reserves the right to add new fields into responses of the current RP API version. Therefore, the RP must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response objects at any location within the JSON structure. It is essential that RP client performs all the required checks when connecting to the Smart-ID RP API HTTPS endpoint, to make sure that the connection endpoint is authentic and that the connection is secure. This is required to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for the authentication and signature protocols. The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS cipher suite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning.

Added device link based interaction flows (QR code, Web2App, App2App) for authentication, signing, and certificate-choice. Added distinct API endpoints for device link and notification based flows. Example: /v3/authentication/device-link/…​ vs. /v3/authentication/notification/…​ App2App and Web2App device link flows include a mandatory initialCallbackUrl parameter. It is used to construct the final callback URL to which the end-user is redirected after a successful PIN entry. Added new signature protocols: ACSP_V2 (Authentication Context Signing Protocol) RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE (signing pre-computed digests) Added capability to link a device link based certificate-choice request to a subsequent notification based signature request via /v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number}. Added an endpoint /v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} to request signing certificates when document number is know. This means that certificate-choice should only be used now before signature sessions in cases where document number is not know (e.g., no prior Smart-ID authentication). To prevent replay attacks, the mandatory rpChallenge parameter (an RP-generated random value) has been introduced for all initial v3 requests, effectively replacing the nonce parameter used in v2. The RSASSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signature padding scheme has been removed and is replaced by RSASSA-PSS, which is now the only supported option for RSA signatures. This change includes support for SHA-3 hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512) with RSASSA-PSS. Revised Verification Code (VC) generation for notification flows: Authentication flows: VC is derived from rpChallenge. Signing flows: VC is randomly generated by the Smart-ID API server. Introduced a possibility for new verification code formats in the future. For now, the existing format (four numbers) will still be the only option. App2App and Web2App device link flows now require callback verification process as part of the response verification process. The certificatechoice (v2) functionality is now certificate-choice (v3). It has been moved to /v3/signature/certificate-choice/…​. It now also supports device link based flows. The allowedInteractionsOrder parameter has been renamed to interactions, and its value (a JSON array of objects) must now be Base64 encoded. The standalone interaction type verificationCodeChoice has been removed. Use confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice instead for flows that require a verification code choice. The RP API server now provides the device link base URL to RPs. The session status response (GET /session/{sessionID}) now includes userChallenge and flowType. Added interactionTypeUsed to v3 responses. Added new session result.endResult status codes: USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION PROTOCOL_FAILURE SERVER_ERROR USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION replaced previous result.endResult status codes (the used interaction type is now provided separately): USER_REFUSED_DISPLAYTEXTANDPIN USER_REFUSED_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE_WITH_VC_CHOICE Uses v2 instead of v1 in URL, {rp-api-baseurl}/v2/ instead of {rp-api-baseurl}/v1/. Introduced allowedInteractionsOrder parameter to authentication and signing requests which replaces displayText and requestProperties.vcChoice parameters. Added interactionTypeUsed parameter to the session status response message.

New option shareMdClientIpAddress for parameter requestProperties Removed previously deprecated object reference pno/:country/:national-identity-number. Use etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural instead.

ACSP_V2 Version 2 of the ACSP protocol. App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Authentication key pair (or authentication key) Key pair that is used to digitally authenticate a person. Certificate Authority (CA) An entity that issues certificates for Smart-ID account owners. Cross-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in a different device. These use cases are usually used with dynamic QR codes and notification flows. Key pair A Pair of keys that are required for digital signature scheme. There are two kinds of key pairs (or shortly, keys) in the Smart-ID system, authentication key pair and signature key pair. The word pair refers to the private and public keys of each key pair used in an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, here RSA. Mobile device A tablet computer or smartphone that runs a mobile device operating system (Apple iOS, Google Android). Person A natural person who uses the Smart-ID system to authenticate herself to an RP and to issue digital signatures requested by RP. Registration Authority (RA) An entity responsible for recording or verifying some or all of the information (particularly the identities of subjects) needed by a CA to issue certificates and CRLs and to perform other certificate management functions. Relying Party request A request from an RP that requires some kind of operation in the Smart-ID backend system. It may or may not create a transaction. Relying Party (RP) An organization or service, for example a bank, that uses the Smart-ID service to authenticate its users and to get them to sign the documents. Same-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in the same device. Signature key pair (or signature key) Key pair that is used to give digital signatures of a person. Smart-ID account A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID system. Account binds a Smart-ID app instance (installed on a person’s mobile device) to a person’s identity in the Smart-ID system. In the course of account creation and registration, the identity of the account owner (person) is proofed by a Registration Authority (RA) and the relation between the identity and a key pair is certified by a Certificate Authority (CA). An account has a signature key pair and an authentication key pair. Smart-ID app A technical component of the Smart-ID system. A mobile app instance installed on a person’s mobile device that provides access to Smart-ID functionality for persons. Smart-ID provider An organization that is legally responsible for the Smart-ID system. Smart-ID server A technical component of the Smart-ID system. Server-side counterpart of the Smart-ID app. Handles backend operations and provides API-s to Relying Party (RP). Smart-ID system A technical and organizational environment that enables digital authentication and issuing of digital signatures of persons in an electronic environment. The Smart-ID system provides services that allow persons (Smart-ID account owners) to authenticate themselves to RPs, to give digital signatures requested by RPs, and to manage their Smart-ID accounts. Users Natural persons with registered Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. Verification Code (VC) Verification codes are 4 numbers shown to the user for notification based (authentication and signature) flows to let the user bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures. The website is integrated with the Smart-ID RP API (this documentation).","title":"Glossary","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.5","name":"glossary","url":"/rp-api/3.1.5/glossary.html","titles":[]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"The authCode parameter is calculated using a sessionSecret value and added to the device links (QR/Web2App/App2App) in order to protect the link from unauthorized changes.

This assembled device link without the authCode parameter is referred to as unprotectedDeviceLink. authCodePayload fields The order of the fields in the authCodePayload must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in QR flows, initialCallbackUrl must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in same-device flows (App2App & Web2App), elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink. in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; Encoding Both Base64 and Base64URL encodings are used in the RP API, be careful to use the appropriate encoding as specified.

Used as the key in authCode calculation. Must be Base64 decoded before use. schemeName Scheme name is defined by Smart-ID service and it ties the link to the Smart-ID context. The schemeName value depends on the environment. See Environments page for concrete values. signatureProtocol Allowed values: ACSP_V2 - for authentication session, RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signature session, empty - for certificate-choice session. rpChallenge rpChallenge used in the initial authentication request. For more details, see ACSP_V2 signature request parameters. digest digest used in the initial signature request. For more details, see RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters. relyingPartyName relyingPartyName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. brokeredRpName brokeredRpName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. This is only used by those RPs that act as a broker for other RPs. Otherwise must be empty. interactions interactions used in the initial authentication or signature request in Base64 encoded form. Empty for certificate-choice session request. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be reused here in order to guarantee that the values match exactly. initialCallbackUrl Callback URL the Smart-ID app will add parameters to and launch after a successful signature has been given (only in Web2App and App2App flows). Must use HTTPS scheme and there must not be URL fragments (#) in the URL. Must be different URLs in App2App and Web2App flows. unprotectedDeviceLink The final URL without the authCode field. Including this in authCode calculation ensures that the link itself can’t be changed by any malicious party. RP API returns sessionSecret in Base64 encoded form. The Base64 string value must be decoded into a byte array before use: sessionSecret := BASE64-DECODE(sessionSecret) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.util.Base64; public class Base64Decode { public static void main(String[] args) { String sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; byte[] sessionSecretBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode( sessionSecretBase64 ); } } <?php $sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; $sessionSecret = base64_decode($sessionSecretBase64); ?> import base64 session_secret_base64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" session_secret_bytes = base64.b64decode(session_secret_base64) package main import ( \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var sessionSecretBase64 string = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" var sessionSecretBytes, err = base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(sessionSecretBase64) if err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Printf(\"%q\\n\", sessionSecretBytes) } use base64::Engine as _; fn main() { let session_secret_base64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; let session_secret_bytes: &[u8] = &base64::engine::general_purpose::STANDARD.decode(session_secret_base64).unwrap(); } import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val sessionSecretBase64: String = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" val sessionSecretBytes: ByteArray = Base64.getDecoder().decode(sessionSecretBase64) } using System; public class Base64Decode { public static void Main(string[] args) { string sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; byte[] sessionSecretBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(sessionSecretBase64); } } const sessionSecretBase64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\"; const sessionSecret = Buffer.from(sessionSecretBase64, 'base64'); require 'base64' session_secret_base64 = \"B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps=\" session_secret = Base64.decode64(session_secret_base64) Example 10. sessionSecret parameter B98ODiVCebRedSwdTk51zFSaGYyHtY1H2A0ocAi3/Ps= Scheme name that ties the link to the Smart-ID context.

The first four are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fifth is a GET request used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The POST v3/authentication/* session endpoints are used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the POST v3/signature/* session endpoints are used to create digital signatures; the POST v3/signature/certificate-choice/* session endpoints are used when the document number is not known immediately prior to the signature session and the user’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; the POST v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} endpoint is used to obtain the signing certificate of the requested document number; finally, the GET v3/session/{sessionID} status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. The implementation details are described on the OpenAPI specification page. There are two types of flows that can be used in v3/authentication/*, v3/signature/* and v3/signature/certificate-choice/* sessions - the device link based flow and the notification based flow. NOTE In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only use device link based flows or only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a device link based flow beforehand. It is up to the RP to decide how to securely identify such devices/browsers and tie them to the Smart-ID document-number by utilizing browser cookies, local app storage or other means. For more details on additional security measures RPs can deploy, see the additional security measures page. There are different ways to reference users - via their issued identifier, a document number linking a specific account or even not at all (in case of device link based flows). The different object references are described on the OpenAPI specification page. IMPORTANT Once a user has been identified within the RP session, then in subsequent signing, certificate-choice and re-authentication session requests the document number reference should be used. The main use cases and which sessions and flows to use are described below. Utilizing the RP API as described below provides the best user experience and security. In the URL examples below and other pages BASE refers to the RP API base address https://rp-api.smart-id.com The following diagram shows main authentication flows and which endpoints to use. The following diagram shows main signature flows and which endpoints to use. Use case: The RP session is on a separate device from the mobile phone where the Smart-ID app is installed. For example, the user is using a PC browser to access an RP website or a tablet to access an RP application. Use case: The RP frontend (whether an RP app or website accessed by a mobile browser) resides on the same mobile device as the Smart-ID app. The end user is using a mobile app or RP detects that the user is on a mobile browser so it can be assumed that the user intends to use the Smart-ID app on a same device. Strongly prefer the BASE/v3/*/device-link/anonymous endpoints for same-device use cases unless the user’s document-number has already been established for the current session. These endpoints provide a superior user experience as no user identifier entry is required while the device-links with callbacks provide the best security protections. However, a fallback option should also be provided to switch to the cross-device use cases. Using the device link based flow is the most secure option and should be preferred. RP may call the anonymous device link based authentication session endpoint and display a dynamic QR code that the user must scan with the Smart-ID app or show a same-device (Web2App, App2App) link the user can interact with. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/anonymous Instead of using the anonymous authentication session endpoint, the RP may request the user to enter their user identifier and utilize the non-anonymous authentication session endpoint. This may be beneficial when the RP utilizes custom usernames and has the users' identifiers stored internally. The RP may simply always ask the user for the identifier as well. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint should be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/document/{document-number} Notification based authentication session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. Using a notification based authentication session endpoint triggers a push notification to all the user’s devices instead of the user scanning the QR code or clicking the same-device link. BASE/v3/authentication/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint can be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/notification/document/{document-number} If a user has already logged onto the RP app or website using Smart-ID authentication, the RP can call the certificate session endpoint to obtain the user’s signing certificate. As the document number is attained from the preceding authentication call, no user interaction is required for the certificate-choice session and the RP API can immediately provide the certificate. BASE/v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} The RP can then call the device link based signature session endpoint to sign using the same Smart-ID account that was used for authentication. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/document/{document-number} The notification based signature session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} If possible, the Smart-ID authentication should be performed before signing and (and after that is completed, instructions in Signing with prior Smart-ID authentication should be followed). In case no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, and certificate is required, the anonymous device link based certificate-choice session endpoint should be used. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/device-link/anonymous Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must call the notification based linked signature session endpoint and provide the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter (session ID of the previous certificate-choice session) to connect the signature and certificate-choice sessions. BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number} The combination of device link based certificate-choice and notification based linked signature session endpoints provides the optimal user experience where Smart-ID app is launched only once and a verification code (VC) is not shown. If the certificate-choice session was completed using a same-device device link, after the flow is completed, the Smart-ID app will launch the callbackUrl given in the device link based certificate-choice. NOTE In the flow described above, it is recommended to stop showing the QR code, Web2App or App2App link in the RP UI after the certificate is obtained. If the certificate is not required, or is already known, the device link based signature session endpoint should be called instead. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} NOTE There is no anonymous device link based signature session endpoint, since in all practical signing use cases the user’s identity is known beforehand. Notification based certificate-choice session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose but is not recommended.

In App2App and Web2App flows, the response verification step must be performed after the user has returned via the callback URL, as described in Callback URLs page. The following steps perform the response verification algorithm. Note that the algorithm is applicable to both authentication and signature session flows. Specific differences, such as the conditional execution of Steps 1 and 3, are noted within the steps. Session secret verification (applicable only for sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Base64 decode the sessionSecret string received in the initial request. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the Base64 decoded sessionSecret value. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Obtain the sessionSecretDigest value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the sessionSecretDigest obtained from the callback URL. Initial session response check: Verify the state field in the JSON response is exactly COMPLETE. Verify the result.endResult field is exactly OK. Verify the signatureProtocol field is exactly ACSP_V2 in case of authentication or RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE in case of signature. Ensure the cert, signature, and result objects are present and not null. User challenge verification (applicable only for authentication sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Obtain the userChallengeVerifier value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the received userChallengeVerifier string. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the signature.userChallenge string provided in the JSON response’s signature object. Certificate Chain Validation and Trust: Decode the Base64 encoded end-entity certificate string from cert.value and parse it into a standard X.509 certificate representation. The RP API provides only the end-entity certificate, the Relying Party must have the necessary root and intermediate CA certificates configured locally to allow the library to build the full certificate chain. For these certificates, see Certificates page. Using a standard cryptographic library, initiate the validation of the certificate chain starting from the end-entity certificate. Provide the end-entity certificate to the library, along with configuring it with the set of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors). It’s important to note that some libraries use the system certificate store in addition to the provided CA certificates, this should be disabled and only the explicitly configured CA certificates should be used. For each certificate in the constructed chain (end-entity certificate and all intermediate CA certificates), perform the following checks. A standard cryptographic library will typically perform the following checks as part of its overall chain validation routine and report the result as a success or failure. Verify the certificate’s digital signature using the public key of its issuer certificate. Verify the certificate’s validity period against the current time, i.e., not before the notBefore date and not after the notAfter date. Verify that the certificate has not been revoked. This check should be performed using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), utilizing the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension within the certificate to locate the OCSP responder URL. If OCSP fails or is unavailable, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking should be used as fallback. Note: Revocation checks (OCSP/CRL) are not performed on self-signed root CA certificates configured as trust anchors. Intermediate CA certificates can be revoked and must be checked. Note: OCSP responses are digitally signed. The certificate chain of the OCSP responder itself should also be verified, ensuring it is trusted and authorized to provide status for the certificate being checked. Verify basic constraints are appropriate: Intermediate CA certificates must have the Basic Constraints extension present with the cA boolean set to TRUE. For end-entity certificates, the Basic Constraints extension should either absent, or if present, its cA boolean should be set to FALSE. Smart-ID Scheme Identification (End-Entity Certificate): Before checking specific purposes, verify that the end-entity certificate belongs to the Smart-ID scheme. Examine the Certificate Policies extension of the end-entity certificate. The certificate must contain all the specific policy OIDs designated by SK ID Solutions for the Smart-ID scheme (as defined in Chapter 2.2.3 of the \"Smart-ID Certificate and OCSP Profile\" in Certificate Profiles page). These OIDs differentiate Smart-ID certificates from other types of certificates (e.g., Mobile-ID, Estonian ID-card). The Relying Party must consult the current official SK ID Solutions Certificate Policies for the definitive list of Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs. For these certificate policies, see Certificate Policies page. If not all the recognized Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs are present, the certificate should not be processed as a Smart-ID certificate, and the verification should fail for this context. End-Entity Certificate Purpose Validation (Smart-ID Context): Examine the end-entity certificate for extensions and attributes required by the certificate profile. For these certificate profiles, see Certificate Profiles page. For Smart-ID authentication: To confirm the certificate is suitable for authentication, it must contain one of the following: The digitalSignature key usage and the Smart-ID authentication (1.3.6.1.4.1.62306.5.7.0) Extended Key Usage which is present in certificates issued April 2025 onwards. The digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment key usages and the id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) Extended Key Usage which is found in older, still valid certificates issued before April 2025. For digital signing: Check for appropriate key usage nonRepudiation. Assurance Level Check: Extract the assurance level string from cert.certificateLevel (e.g., ADVANCED, QUALIFIED). For qualified certificates, check that the extension values as defined by the certificate profile exist within the certificate from cert.value. Compare this level against the minimum assurance level required by the RP for the specific context or transaction. Ensure the certificate’s level meets or exceeds the required level (note that ADVANCED < QUALIFIED). Identity Match Check: Extract the authenticated user’s identifier from the end-entity certificate. For Smart-ID certificates serialNumber (OID 2.5.4.5) under Subject DN contain the national identity code, for example PNOEE-30001010004. If the RP initiated the authentication or signing for a specific known user, verify that the extracted identifier matches the expected identity for that session. Verification of signature Object (authentication/signature session): Only for authentication session: Reconstruct the exact ACSP_V2_payload string that was signed, as described under ACSP_V2 digest calculation. This is done by concatenating the fields in order, separated by the vertical bar character | (U+007C): 'smart-id'|'ACSP_V2'|serverRandom|rpChallenge|userChallenge|BASE64(relyingPartyName)|BASE64(brokeredRpName)|BASE64(SHA-256(interactions))|interactionTypeUsed|initialCallbackUrl|flowType Only for signature session: Use the data-to-be-signed, a digest of which was initially sent when initiating the signature session (as described in RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol). Decode the signature value from signature.value using Base64 decoding. Obtain the public key from the parsed end-entity user certificate (from Step 4). Only for authentication session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against the UTF-8 bytes of the reconstructed ACSP_V2_payload string. Only for signature session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against either the data-to-be-signed or the hash of the data-to-be-signed (there are libraries that provide options for either). Ensure the verification uses the algorithm specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm (e.g., rsassa-pss) and correctly applies the parameters from signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters (e.g., hash algorithm like SHA-512, MGF1 hash like SHA-512, salt length like 64, and the trailer field 0xbc). Session Management (Only for authentication sessions. Important: only perform if all the preceding steps (1-9) were successful): Invalidate any previous, unauthenticated session identifier associated with the user’s interaction (e.g., browser cookie or API token used before successful authentication). Generate a new, secure, and unique session identifier representing the now authenticated state. Associate the authenticated user’s identity (from Step 8) and potentially the assurance level (from Step 7) with this new session identifier in your server-side session store. After a successful action, the users should be able to view their actions or download the signed document.

In RP API v3, new signature protocols for authentication and signing use cases have been introduced in order to maximize the security benefits for each use case: Signature protocol ACSP_V2 - for authentication requests, Signature protocol RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signing requests. Authentication Context Signature Protocol (ACSP) is a protocol that is used for authentication requests. In ACSP_v2, the final data-to-be-signed object incorporates multiple factors such as a challenge from the Relying Party (rpChallenge), a server-provided random factor (serverRandom), and a random factor from the user’s mobile device (userChallenge).

The digest is calculated over the ACSP_V2_payload, and ACSP_V2_payload is assembled using vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator. Rules of generating the digest value: in case initialCallbackUrl does not exist (for QR and Notification flows), this field must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in case the RP is not acting as a broker, the brokeredRpName must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; interactions must be the same Base64-encoded byte string value that was used to initiate the session. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), trying to encode the same object again might return a different value; the digest must be calculated from UTF-8 encoded byte array that consists of the described elements joined in the specified order with vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator, this also applies to Base64 encoded values, they must be used as is without Base64 decoding; Base64 encoding must also make sure that the unused bits are set to 0 and that the resulting values are correctly padded with = signs; the hash algorithm to use is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters.hashAlgorithm. The signature scheme that was used to generate the signature based on the digest is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm. message := STR-CONCAT( 'smart-id', '|', 'ACSP_V2', '|', serverRandom, '|', rpChallenge, '|', userChallenge, '|', BASE64-ENCODE(relyingPartyName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(brokeredRpName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(SHA-256(interactions)), '|', interactionTypeUsed, '|', initialCallbackUrl, '|', flowType) digest := HASH(UTF8-ENCODE(message)) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE is a signature protocol where a pre-calculated digest (hash) of the data-to-be-signed is sent in the initial request, and the digital signature is generated directly on this provided digest. For verification, the digest itself or the complete original data that corresponds to the digest must be used. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signatureProtocol and signatureProtocolParameters parameters in the signature requests and examples, see the API spec signature request parameters. The digest value sent with the initial RP request is the digest value of the data-to-be-signed. One of the supported hash algorithms must be used. The signature is directly generated on the digest value and the verification must be done using the data-to-be-signed. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature parameter in the signature response and examples, see the API spec session status response parameters. Full verification of the signature and response is described in Response verification. NOTE When integrating with Smart-ID RP API for electronic signing, note that RP API v3 and above only supports RSASSA-PSS signature scheme. Previous versions supported only the legacy RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme. Some national signature container formats do not support RSASSA-PSS and if alternatives are not available (such as the ASiC format that is internationally recognized), previous RP API versions might have to be used to obtain RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signatures.","title":"Signature protocols","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.5","name":"signature_protocols","url":"/rp-api/3.1.5/signature_protocols.html","titles":[{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature protocol","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_protocol","id":1},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature request parameters","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_request_parameters","id":2},{"text":"rpChallenge generation","hash":"_rpchallenge_generation","id":3},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature response parameters","hash":"_acsp_v2_signature_response_parameters","id":4},{"text":"ACSP_V2 digest calculation","hash":"acsp_v2_digest_calculation","id":5},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol","hash":"raw_digest_signature_protocol","id":6},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters","hash":"raw_digest_signature_request_parameters","id":7},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE digest value","hash":"raw_digest_signature_digest_calculation","id":8},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature response parameters","hash":"_raw_digest_signature_signature_response_parameters","id":9}]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"The device link flows are the primary flows to be used for initiating Smart-ID transactions. It consists of the following steps: User interacts with an RP frontend (a webpage or an app). RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a device link based session (authentication, signature, or certificate-choice) to obtain security parameters that are necessary for generating device links. For authentication and certificate-choice sessions, the request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous (signature session can’t be anonymous). RP starts creating device links. In case of QR codes, but not Web2App nor App2App links, the links must be updated each second. The device links must be generated in the RP backend and then forwarded to the RP frontend each time. RP frontend displays QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning the dynamic QR code (preferred option for QR codes); Using a native camera app to scan the dynamic QR code (not supported by all camera apps) which opens the Smart-ID app where user has to scan the QR code again. Clicking on the Web2App link in an RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on the App2App link in an RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and freshness of the device link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. The user is asked to verify the transaction details and enter their PIN. After the signature has been given, the RP receives the result via the session status endpoint. In case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). User is redirected back to the RP with the given callback URL in same-device flows and RP performs the callback URL verification steps described in Callback URLs page. IMPORTANT For device link flows, a single request must be sent. For a single session that displays both a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, multiple requests must not be sent. Some examples: If an RP would like to display a Web2App or App2App link without a dynamic QR code, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started. If an RP would like to display a dynamic QR code without the option for Web2App or App2App links, a device link flow can be started without a callback URL. If an RP would like to display both, a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started (but the callback URL will only be relevant if the user interacts with the Web2App/App2App link, not the QR code). In same-device flow, it may be easier for RP to send a request to session status endpoint only after the callback has been received. This is only relevant when the QR code flow is not provided. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the authentication session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the signature session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the certificateChoice session. When RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a new device link based session, RP API server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique value that is used to connect this authentication/signing attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - Base64 encoded key value that must be kept secret and must not be shared with any other party (including RP frontend); deviceLinkBase - the base URL to be used to generate the QR/Web2App/App2App device links. RP then calculates the Web2App or App2App device link and dynamic QR code and shows it to the end user. The dynamic QR code must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second. It is recommended that RP offers multiple options, QR image and Web2App link, to the user at the same time if either: RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC, The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device, and might want to authenticate using a separate mobile device. NOTE The device link structure is similar for both same-device and cross-device flows. The differences between them are: The value of deviceLinkType is different (Web2App, App2App vs QR), same-device links do not have elapsedSeconds and should not be dynamically regenerated, the final representation of the link to the user is different (a clickable HTTPS link vs a dynamic QR code). IMPORTANT All values in the deviceLink are case-sensitive. The resulting deviceLink must match bit by bit with the expected deviceLink in the Smart-ID backend. There must not be URL encoding in the deviceLink. There must not be URL fragment (#) in the deviceLink. The order of the path parameters in the device link must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; in QR flows, initialCallbackUrl must be included as an empty field; in same-device flows, elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink.

QR code (authentication session) For more details on how the dynamic QR code or other device links should be presented in the RP frontend, see Device link and QR presentation section. The table below explains the parameters that are included in the device link calculation. Parameter Formula version A pre-defined version value, currently 1.0. sessionToken Generated by RP API. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is. deviceLinkType Allowed values: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. sessionType Allowed values: auth - for authentication session, sign - signature session, cert - certificate-choice session. elapsedSeconds Seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. Only used in cross-device flows (dynamic QR code). lang An ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It should match the language that the user was seeing in the RP UI previously. This only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. authCode Calculated using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, using sessionSecret as the key, authCodePayload as the payload, and represented in Base64URL encoding. Explained in a separate page. IMPORTANT The calculation of device links must be performed in the RP backend. All values (including elapsedSeconds) must all be generated in the RP backend and the RP frontend must not be able to change or affect these parameters. For dynamic QR code flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to leak the sessionSecret parameter. Also, it is forbidden to generate values of authCode parameter ahead of time and forward them to the RP frontend/app. version parameter is a pre-defined value. Currently, only 1.0 is supported. It must be used in string form in device links. Example 6. version parameter \"1.0\" RP API returns sessionToken. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 7. sessionToken parameter \"wGIrqveE6AuGDATZKmR1mtAZ\" The parameter deviceLinkType describes the device link type: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 8. deviceLinkType parameter \"QR\" The parameter sessionType describes the session type: auth - for authentication session, sign - for signature session, cert - for certificate-choice session. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 9. sessionType parameter \"auth\" The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial session creation request to RP API. Notice that dynamic QR code link must be re-calculated each second because the elapsedSeconds value changes. elapsedSeconds value must be converted to string value to be used in QR code links: elapsedSeconds := TO-STRING(elapsedSeconds) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby public class Int2Str { public static void main(String[] args) { int elapsedSeconds = 22; String elapsedSecondsStr = Integer.toString(elapsedSeconds); System.out.println(elapsedSecondsStr); } } <?php $elapsedSeconds = 22; $elapsedSecondsStr = strval($elapsedSeconds); echo $elapsedSecondsStr; ?> elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = str(elapsed_seconds) print(elapsed_seconds_str) package main import ( \"fmt\" \"strconv\" ) func main() { var elapsedSeconds int = 22 var elapsedSecondsStr string = strconv.Itoa(elapsedSeconds) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", elapsedSecondsStr) } fn main() { let elapsed_seconds: i32 = 22; let elapsed_seconds_str: String = elapsed_seconds.to_string(); println!(\"{}\", elapsed_seconds_str) } fun main() { val elapsedSeconds: Int = 22 val elapsedSecondsStr: String = elapsedSeconds.toString() println(elapsedSecondsStr) } using System; public class Int2Str { public static void Main() { int elapsedSeconds = 22; string elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.ToString(); Console.WriteLine(elapsedSecondsStr); } } let elapsedSeconds = 22; let elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.toString(); console.log(elapsedSecondsStr); elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = elapsed_seconds.to_s puts elapsed_seconds_str Example 10. elapsedSeconds parameter \"22\" The lang parameter defines the interface language for the HTTPS fallback page that is shown to the user when there are technical problems regarding opening device links (for example, if user’s browser does not support Web2App links and needs to be configured to allow them or if Smart-ID app is not installed on the phone). Its format must be ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It is recommended that for consistent user experience, RP provides here the same language that the user was already using in the RP UI. This parameter only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. Example 11. lang parameter \"eng\" authCode parameter generation is explained in detail in authCode calculation page. The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters involved in device link construction should be accessible by which parties (see legend below). The table also includes parameters which are used for authCode calculation (e.g. unprotectedDeviceLink) — for their descriptions, see authCode calculation page. RP API server RP backend RP frontend/app version sessionID sessionToken sessionSecret deviceLinkType sessionType signatureProtocol rpChallenge digest relyingPartyName brokeredRpName interactions initialCallbackUrl unprotectedDeviceLink elapsedSeconds authCode lang Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - does not know parameter - MUST NOT know parameter For cases when the app is not installed or some other problem occurs with opening a device link, a fallback HTTPS webpage is opened with instructions on how to resolve the issue. The lang parameter in the link is by default used to show the same language as on the RP UI. The instructions cover the following scenarios: User is not on a mobile device where Smart-ID app is installed and has been allowed by the RP to use a wrong type of device link (e.g. a same-device link on a PC). Smart-ID App is not installed on the current device. Mobile browser does not support universal links / Android App links. Mobile OS/browser settings disallow the link and user intervention is required. For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW or MEDIUM should be used. HIGH cannot be used due to the typical device link length. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal block size for QR code is 6-10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues, although many will not). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning and take up too much space. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. QR code can be generated on the client or server. It is recommended to use the SVG format as it remains sharp when users zoom the page. Note that many QR code libraries that support SVG output do not accept block size as an input parameter. So, block size should be estimated based on overall image dimensions, device link length and error correction level. See QR generator section for an example which also calculates the resulting block size in pixels. IMPORTANT The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, however the link itself must only be generated by the RP backend. This is because sensitive parameters such as sessionSecret must never be sent to the RP frontend. This form allows you to test different QR code sizes with the recommended parameters and estimate the block size in pixels.

Different interactions can support different amount of data to display information to user. Each interaction is defined by an object that has 2 parameters: type and either displayText60 or displayText200. The following table shows interaction types available for each flow type. Linked notification based flow refers to the BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint. Interaction type & extra parameter Description Device link based flows Notification based flows Linked notification based flow displayTextAndPIN with displayText60 The simplest interaction with max 60 chars of text and PIN entry on a single screen. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessage with displayText200 First screen is for text only (max 200 chars) and has Confirm and Cancel buttons. Second screen is for PIN. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice with displayText200 First screen combines text and Verification Code choice. Second screen is for PIN. No Yes No All three interactions types are currently supported by all the clients. RP uses interactions parameter to list interactions it allows for the current session. New interaction types may be introduced in the future. However, it takes some time until all apps have been updated and are actually capable of displaying the new types. After introduction of a new interaction type both the new interaction type as a well as an older type should be provided in the array for clients that have not been yet updated. The interactions parameter is a Base64 encoded JSON array and the order of the items is significant. Each interaction in the array is a JSON object consisting of the type, and either displayText60 or displayText200. The first interaction that is supported by a specific app installation will be used. The interaction that was used is always reported back to RP with interactionTypeUsed response parameter to the session request. If an app cannot support any interaction requested then the session is cancelled with reason code REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP. IMPORTANT The following requirements apply for the interaction object: For each interaction, the type and the corresponding displayText (either displayText60 or displayText200) parameters are mandatory. Meaning that each interaction must include a non-empty displayText60 or displayText200 parameter. It is forbidden to provide both displayText60 and displayText200 parameters. It is not allowed to have more than one interaction with the same type value. In addition, it is not allowed to list interaction types not meant for the flow (device link flow or notification based flow). JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional). Therefore, the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be stored and reused in all subsequent calculations. This is relevant for all device link flows, more specifically in: authCode calculation; ACSP_V2 digest calculation (authentication only) during response verification. Failing to meet the first 4 requirements above will result in an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request). Failing to follow the last recommendation can result in some dynamic link sessions failing. If authCode calculation returns a different value from what RP API calculates, then the device link will be rejected due to wrong authCode value. If ACSP_V2 digest is calculated incorrectly, a valid user authentication signature will appear to be invalid and RP will have to deny the authentication attempt. displayText is a short text string displayed to the user in the Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent screen. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Smart-ID to authenticate users calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use a different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. displayText value can only be set by the RP backend and phishing attacks can’t change it. This is why, it is recommended to use the displayText to alert users and show warnings if an attack is suspected. For more details, see Additional security measures page. The displayText60 and displayText200 parameters are used by the Smart-ID app to display text on the screen. The preferred way of writing displayText60 and displayText200 is to explain the action user is taking which the user is expected to confirm. The descriptions should be concise and specific allowing the user to verify the context of the operation quickly. A few examples: Logging in to internet banking Log in to mobile banking app Applying for a credit card application, 1000€ credit limit Signing document Contract.asice Transfer 1000€ to Jane Doe GB33BUKB20201555555555 Usually, the Relying Party name does not need to be part of the display text as the RP name parameter is always displayed to the user along with the display text. Before sending the RP API request, interactions array must be turned into a string and then Base64 encoded. The interactions JSON should be minified to lower the overhead. The Base64 encoding can be done as follows: interactions := BASE64-ENCODE(TO-STRING(MINIFY(interactionsJson))) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

Commonly Smart-ID is used together with national identity numbers, however these national identity numbers might not be secret and could be enumerated. A better approach is to use anonymous device links which require the user to initiate the authentication process. If the anonymous device links can’t be used for some reason, then the RP may ask for national identity number and a non-public identifier as well. This non-public identifier can be a username the users can choose, the account contract number or something else only the user knows. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whenever the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to log in from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter, an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. IMPORTANT Using the User-Agent field for device/browser identification is not secure and should be avoided as it can be easily spoofed by a malicious party. The following are recommendations for setting up tracking for trusted and unknown browsers: The tracking must be done with an HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage features supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier (trackingID). The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The RP database must keep previously seen browsers with the randomly generated identifier hash (hashedTrackingID), and the RP may allow the user to edit the names of the known browsers. The browser cookie must be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags, and the scope of the cookie must be the URL of the RP’s website. The RP website or app must allow the user to invalidate all the cookies on the RP server. A simple algorithm to set the hashedTrackingID for the user and browser combination can be used: If a valid trackingID is not present, and authentication succeeds, set the trackingID and save it in the database for the particular user and browser combination. If a valid trackingID for the particular user and browser combination is present, the browser can be trusted. Additional security measures can be used if a new connection from an unknown browser is made, such as: asking for the user’s national identity number, sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\". When a user connects to the RP’s website or the app, it connects from the IP address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s or proxy’s IP address. There are commercial services that can provide general information about IP addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP address is known to be used for: sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer, is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate that the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer or that an attacker might be using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymizing VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be an IP address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network, which may indicate that the requests might be used to perform denial-of-service or data mining attacks. In addition to such commercial services, RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. Additional security measures can be used if the IP address is determined to be suspicious, such as: sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from a suspicious IP address. Are you authenticating to https://rp.example.com?\", performing a CAPTCHA verification, block connections from malicious IP addresses. It is important to give the user an option to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on their account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognize and that could point to security incidents. RPs must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. RP should record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website or app. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty that: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to a blocklist; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organizations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. Preferences cookies which are mentioned above for tracking trusted and unknown browsers require users' consent, and the information about using the cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data, the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Additional security measures","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.5","name":"additional_security_measures","url":"/rp-api/3.1.5/additional_security_measures.html","titles":[{"text":"Anonymous flows and user identifiers","hash":"_anonymous_flows_and_user_identifiers","id":1},{"text":"Keeping track of trusted and unknown browsers","hash":"_keeping_track_of_trusted_and_unknown_browsers","id":2},{"text":"Keeping track of suspicious and malicious IP addresses","hash":"_keeping_track_of_suspicious_and_malicious_ip_addresses","id":3},{"text":"Allowing users to verify operations","hash":"allowing-users-to-verify-operations","id":4},{"text":"Monitoring usage patterns","hash":"_monitoring_usage_patterns","id":5},{"text":"Responding to security incidents","hash":"_responding_to_security_incidents","id":6},{"text":"Personal data processing","hash":"_personal_data_processing","id":7}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"OpenAPI specification :: Smart-ID documentation Smart-ID documentation Back to docs Smart-ID Documentation Getting started Try out Smart-ID integration Environments Device-link fallback page Implementing HTTPS pinning Client libraries Logos Test accounts Contact Relying Party API Introduction Introduction Changes Glossary Device link flows authCode calculation Notification based flows OpenAPI specification API technical description Interactions Signature protocols Callback URLs Response verification Additional security measures Relying Party API 3.1.5 Documentation Relying Party API 3.1.7 3.1.6 3.1.5 3.1.4 3.1.3 3.0.3 Scalar.createApiReference('#app', { url: '../_/static/RP-API_V3.yml', showSidebar: true, hideModels: true, withDefaultFonts: false, darkMode: false, hideDarkModeToggle: true, forceDarkModeState: 'light', hideDarkModeToggle: true, hideClientButton: true, customCss: ` #app { --scalar-color-1: var(--caption-font-color);

To force the user to perform the verification, the RP can request the Smart-ID app to display three VCs (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code which is displayed by the RP website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice interaction type. For details of the interactions object, see Interactions page. NOTE In case of same-device use cases where the recommended App2App or Web2App device link flow cannot be used for some reason, then in notification flows it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app before the push notification arrives. Below, sequence diagrams are given along with explanations of the differences. The following diagram describes the notification based flow for the authentication session. The following sequence diagram illustrates the notification based signing flow. The following sequence diagram illustrates the device link based certificate choice flow being linked to a notification based signing flow. There are separate signing protocols for authentication and signature requests (see signature protocols for details). In RP API v3 notification based authentication requests, RP must compute verification codes (VC) for each authentication request, so the user can bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. The VC is computed as follows: Calculate SHA-256 from the rpChallenge, extract 2 rightmost bytes from the result, interpret them as a big-endian unsigned integer and take the last 4 digits in decimal form for display. SHA-256 must be used to calculate the VC. Please keep in mind that the rpChallenge is the real rpChallenge byte value (for example, the byte array returned from the SecureRandom() or equivalent method), not the Base64 encoded form used for transport or the popular hexadecimal representation. The VC value must be displayed to the user in the browser together with a message asking the end user to verify the code matches with the one displayed on their mobile device. The user must not proceed if these don’t match. integer(SHA-256(rpChallenge)[-2:-1]) mod 10000 Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.math.BigInteger; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.security.MessageDigest; import java.util.Base64; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode( rpChallengeBase64 ); MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); md.update(rpChallengeBytes); byte[] sha256Hash = md.digest(); BigInteger LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK = new BigInteger(\"65535\"); BigInteger result = new BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(new BigInteger(\"10000\")); String verificationCode = String.format(\"%04d\", result); System.out.println(verificationCode); } } <?php $rpChallengeBase64 = base64_decode('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg=='); $sha256Hash = hash('sha256', $rpChallengeBase64, true); $result = hexdec(bin2hex(substr($sha256Hash, -2))) % 10000; $verificationCode = sprintf('%04d', $result); echo $verificationCode; ?> import base64 import hashlib rp_challenge_base64 = b\"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" rp_challenge_bytes = base64.b64decode(rp_challenge_base64) sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(rp_challenge_bytes).digest() result = int.from_bytes(sha256_hash[-2:], byteorder='big') % 10000 verification_code = f\"{result:04d}\" print(verification_code) package main import ( \"crypto/sha256\" \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var rpChallengeBase64 string = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" var rpChallengeBytes, err = base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(rpChallengeBase64) if err != nil { panic(err) } var sha256Hash [32]byte = sha256.Sum256(rpChallengeBytes) var result int = int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-2])<<8 + int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-1]) result %= 10000 var verificationCode string = fmt.Sprintf(\"%04d\", result) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\",verificationCode) } use base64::decode; use sha2::{Sha256, Digest}; fn main() { let rp_challenge_base64: &str = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; let rp_challenge_bytes = decode(rp_challenge_base64).unwrap(); let sha256_hash = Sha256::digest(&rp_challenge_bytes); let result = (((sha256_hash[30] as u16) << 8) + (sha256_hash[31] as u16)) % 10000; let verification_code: String = format!(\"{:04}\", result); println!(\"{}\", verification_code); } import java.math.BigInteger import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets import java.security.MessageDigest import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val rpChallengeBase64: String = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" val rpChallengeBytes: ByteArray = Base64.getDecoder().decode(rpChallengeBase64) val sha256Hash: ByteArray = MessageDigest .getInstance(\"SHA-256\") .digest(rpChallengeBytes) val LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK: BigInteger = BigInteger(\"65535\") val result: BigInteger = BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(BigInteger(\"10000\")) val verificationCode = \"%04d\".format(result) println(verificationCode) } using System; using System.Security.Cryptography; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void Main(string[] args) { string rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(rpChallengeBase64); using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create()) { byte[] sha256Hash = sha256.ComputeHash(rpChallengeBytes); int result = ((sha256Hash[30] << 8) + (sha256Hash[31])) % 10000; string verificationCode = result.ToString(\"D4\"); Console.WriteLine(verificationCode); } } } const crypto = require('crypto'); const rpChallenge = Buffer.from('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==', 'base64'); const sha256 = crypto.createHash('sha256'); sha256.update(rpChallenge); const sha256Hash = sha256.digest(); const result = sha256Hash.readUInt16BE(30) % 10000 .toString() .padStart(4, '0'); console.log(result); require 'base64' require 'digest' rp_challenge = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" sha256_hash = Digest::SHA256.digest(Base64.decode64(rp_challenge)) last_2_bytes = sha256_hash[-2..-1].unpack('n*').first result = (last_2_bytes % 10_000).to_s.rjust(4, '0') puts result Example 1.

IMPORTANT If Web2App and App2App flows are used by the same RP, the initialCallbackUrl base (without the random parameter) must be different for both flows, otherwise Web2App flow callbackUrl might wrongly end up in the RP app. For Web2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP website. RP website backend has to set a session cookie to the user’s browser. This cookie must be set as SameSite=Lax because later, the Smart-ID app will launch the callback URL using top-level navigation and the request type will be GET. RP website backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP website backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL address of RP website and their browser will have the same session cookie. Some aspects to take into account are: User will end up on a new browser tab; The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP website sends the callback URL to RP website backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP website backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session cookie matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; Verify that the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret equals to sessionSecretDigest in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. callbackUrl must be invalidated after use and must not be accepted after it is used once. Failing to invalidate the callbackUrl after use may leave the user vulnerable to a phishing attack. Redirect the user to a new page and show authenticated session. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. In cases where user initiated the authentication/signing flow on a mobile browser that was not their default browser, the HTTPS callback URL will probably be opened in the default browser which will not have the session cookie and thus the verification must fail. The protocol steps for handling App2App callback URLs are functionally the same as for Web2App; however, there are also some differences in the steps below due to fundamental differences between webpages and apps. For App2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP app. RP app has to save a session identifier in the app’s storage. RP app backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP app backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL, which will cause RP app to open (for this to work, RP app has to be configured to handle that domain and path of the URL). The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP app sends the callback URL together with the session identifier from storage to RP app backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP app backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session identifier matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; Verify that the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret equals to sessionSecretDigest in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. callbackUrl must be invalidated after use and must not be accepted after it is used once. Failing to invalidate the callbackUrl after use may leave the user vulnerable to a phishing attack. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. Linked notification based flows are used in cases where the certificate of the user is required before the digest to be signed can be generated. In these flows callbackUrl is required and it is supplied by the RP in the initial device link based certificate choice request. However, the callbackUrl is not immediately used after the certificate choice request, and is only used after the /v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint is called with the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter and the flow is completed. If the initial callback URL provided by RP backend is: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ then in the authentication flow the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc&userChallengeVerifier=XtPfaGa8JnGtYrJjboooUf0KfY9sMEHrWFpSQrsUv9c In the signature and certificate-choice flows the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc For both Web2App and App2App callback URLs, the checks described above provide complete phishing resistance. Always prefer device link flows if possible.

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases, i.e. authentication and signing. The main Smart-ID use case is of a Relying Party (RP) starting a session by calling the Smart-ID service RP API with a challenge when the user wishes to authenticate with the Relying Party’s service or a hash to create a digital signature. Depending on the chosen RP API endpoint, either the user scans a dynamic QR code or (in the same-device use case) the user clicks a link that launches the Smart-ID application, or the Smart-ID server sends a push notification to the application. The user then verifies the details of the transaction displayed by the Smart-ID application and confirms it. The Smart-ID application communicates with the Smart-ID server to generate the digital signature which makes it available for the Relying Party to be fetched. Meanwhile, the Relying Party has been waiting for a reply from the Smart-ID server using a long poll connection. In the case of success, it receives the signature and the user’s certificate to validate the result. The service creates digital signatures as proof of authentication and signing. However, to create electronic signatures (ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES signatures or PDF with PAdES signatures) the Relying Party must create the required document structure themselves, calculate the hash and have that signed using this API. The latest version of the API introduces new flows collectively referred to as \"device link flows\". For cross-device use cases — dynamic QR codes that the user must scan; for same-device use cases where the user is visiting an RP webpage using a mobile browser — device links which the user must click; for same-device use cases where the user is using an RP app — device links which the user must click. The guiding principle in designing the API has been to unify the three aforementioned flows as much as possible to minimize the integration efforts for RPs. Because of this, they mostly share the same security mechanisms and principles, even though the methods used to launch the Smart-ID application are completely different. This also means it is possible for an RP to offer multiple alternative methods of authentication at the same time without making multiple requests to the RP API. In the latest RP API version 3, the notification based flows will still be available, but for maximum security, it is recommended they are only used if the particular user has been authenticated at least once before on the device by one of the more secure device link flows. This can be accomplished by utilizing the client device’s local storage (e.g. browser cookies, local app storage). Device link based flows must always be used in the same-device use case for both usability and security reasons. Brokers of the Smart-ID service are treated similarly to Relying Parties (RPs) and there is no extra configuration compared to previous RP API versions. Although Smart-ID service is a secure technology designed with security in mind, Relying Parties (RPs) need to consider potential risks which are associated with digital authentication and signing solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users understand the context of their actions and protect them from possible attacks. Throughout this integration guide, we describe effective security measures for mitigating attacks, however not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the RP’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Throughout this document, there will be blocks of text as shown below. IMPORTANT Important blocks like these must be followed by every RP without exceptions. These blocks show important points of the API which might lead to security issues or failures if implemented wrongly. NOTE Blocks that look like this present additional information and optional features. TIP Blocks that look like this link to other related sections in the guide.

Commonly Smart-ID is used together with national identity numbers, however these national identity numbers might not be secret and could be enumerated. A better approach is to use anonymous device links which require the user to initiate the authentication process. If the anonymous device links can’t be used for some reason, then the RP may ask for national identity number and a non-public identifier as well. This non-public identifier can be a username the users can choose, the account contract number or something else only the user knows. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whenever the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to log in from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter, an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. IMPORTANT Using the User-Agent field for device/browser identification is not secure and should be avoided as it can be easily spoofed by a malicious party. The following are recommendations for setting up tracking for trusted and unknown browsers: The tracking must be done with an HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage features supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier (trackingID). The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The RP database must keep previously seen browsers with the randomly generated identifier hash (hashedTrackingID), and the RP may allow the user to edit the names of the known browsers. The browser cookie must be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags, and the scope of the cookie must be the URL of the RP’s website. The RP website or app must allow the user to invalidate all the cookies on the RP server. A simple algorithm to set the hashedTrackingID for the user and browser combination can be used: If a valid trackingID is not present, and authentication succeeds, set the trackingID and save it in the database for the particular user’s personal number and browser combination. If a valid trackingID for the particular user and browser combination is present, the browser can be trusted. Additional security measures can be used if a new connection from an unknown browser is made, such as: asking for the user’s national identity number, sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\". When a user connects to the RP’s website or the app, it connects from the IP address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s or proxy’s IP address. There are commercial services that can provide general information about IP addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP address is known to be used for: sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer, is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate that the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer or that an attacker might be using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymizing VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be an IP address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network, which may indicate that the requests might be used to perform denial-of-service or data mining attacks. In addition to such commercial services, RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. Additional security measures can be used if the IP address is determined to be suspicious, such as: sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from a suspicious IP address. Are you authenticating to https://rp.example.com?\", performing a CAPTCHA verification, block connections from malicious IP addresses. It is important to give the user an option to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on their account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognize and that could point to security incidents. RPs must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. RP should record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website or app. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty that: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to a blocklist; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organizations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. Preferences cookies which are mentioned above for tracking trusted and unknown browsers require users' consent, and the information about using the cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data, the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Additional security measures","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.6","name":"additional_security_measures","url":"/rp-api/3.1.6/additional_security_measures.html","titles":[{"text":"Anonymous flows and user identifiers","hash":"_anonymous_flows_and_user_identifiers","id":1},{"text":"Keeping track of trusted and unknown browsers","hash":"_keeping_track_of_trusted_and_unknown_browsers","id":2},{"text":"Keeping track of suspicious and malicious IP addresses","hash":"_keeping_track_of_suspicious_and_malicious_ip_addresses","id":3},{"text":"Allowing users to verify operations","hash":"allowing-users-to-verify-operations","id":4},{"text":"Monitoring usage patterns","hash":"_monitoring_usage_patterns","id":5},{"text":"Responding to security incidents","hash":"_responding_to_security_incidents","id":6},{"text":"Personal data processing","hash":"_personal_data_processing","id":7}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"OpenAPI specification :: Smart-ID documentation Smart-ID documentation Back to docs Smart-ID Documentation Getting started Try out Smart-ID integration Environments Device link fallback page HTTPS pinning Client libraries Suggestions Logos FAQ App Release Notes Contact Automated testing Introduction Device link test endpoint Test accounts Relying Party API Introduction Changes Glossary Overview of API endpoints OpenAPI specification Device link flows authCode calculation Notification based flows API technical description Interactions Signature protocols Callback URLs Response verification Additional security measures Relying Party API 3.1.6 Documentation Relying Party API 3.1.7 3.1.6 3.1.5 3.1.4 3.1.3 3.0.3 Scalar.createApiReference('#app', { url: '../_/static/RP-API_V3.yml', showSidebar: true, hideModels: true, withDefaultFonts: false, darkMode: false, hideDarkModeToggle: true, forceDarkModeState: 'light', hideDarkModeToggle: true, hideClientButton: true, customCss: ` #app { --scalar-color-1: var(--caption-font-color);

Used as the key in authCode calculation. Must be Base64 decoded before use. schemeName Scheme name is defined by Smart-ID service and it ties the link to the Smart-ID context. The schemeName value depends on the environment. See Environments page for concrete values. signatureProtocol Allowed values: ACSP_V2 - for authentication session, RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signature session, empty - for certificate-choice session. rpChallenge rpChallenge used in the initial authentication request. For more details, see ACSP_V2 signature request parameters. digest digest used in the initial signature request. For more details, see RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters. relyingPartyName relyingPartyName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. brokeredRpName brokeredRpName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. This is only used by those RPs that act as a broker for other RPs. Otherwise must be empty. interactions interactions used in the initial authentication or signature request in Base64 encoded form. Empty for certificate-choice session request. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be reused here in order to guarantee that the values match exactly. initialCallbackUrl Callback URL the Smart-ID app will add parameters to and launch after a successful signature has been given (only in Web2App and App2App flows). Must use HTTPS scheme and there must not be URL fragments (#) in the URL. Must be different URLs in App2App and Web2App flows. unprotectedDeviceLink The final URL without the authCode field. Including this in authCode calculation ensures that the link itself can’t be changed by any malicious party. RP API returns sessionSecret in Base64 encoded form.

It consists of the following steps: User interacts with an RP frontend (a webpage or an app). RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a device link based session (authentication, signature, or certificate-choice) to obtain security parameters that are necessary for generating device links. For authentication and certificate-choice sessions, the request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous (signature session can’t be anonymous). RP starts creating device links. In case of QR codes, but not Web2App nor App2App links, the links must be updated each second. The device links must be generated in the RP backend and then forwarded to the RP frontend each time. RP frontend displays QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning the dynamic QR code (preferred option for QR codes); Using a native camera app to scan the dynamic QR code (not supported by all camera apps) which opens the Smart-ID app where user has to scan the QR code again. Clicking on the Web2App link in an RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on the App2App link in an RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and freshness of the device link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. The user is asked to verify the transaction details and enter their PIN. After the signature has been given, the RP receives the result via the session status endpoint. In case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). User is redirected back to the RP with the given callback URL in same-device flows and RP performs the callback URL verification steps described in Callback URLs page. IMPORTANT For device link flows, a single request must be sent. For a single session that displays both a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, multiple requests must not be sent. Some examples: If an RP would like to display a Web2App or App2App link without a dynamic QR code, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started. If an RP would like to display a dynamic QR code without the option for Web2App or App2App links, a device link flow can be started without a callback URL. If an RP would like to display both, a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started (but the callback URL will only be relevant if the user interacts with the Web2App/App2App link, not the QR code). In same-device flow, it may be easier for RP to send a request to session status endpoint only after the callback has been received. This is only relevant when the QR code flow is not provided. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the authentication session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the signature session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the certificateChoice session. When RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a new device link based session, RP API server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique value that is used to connect this authentication/signing attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - Base64 encoded key value that must be kept secret and must not be shared with any other party (including RP frontend); deviceLinkBase - the base URL to be used to generate the QR/Web2App/App2App device links. RP then calculates the Web2App or App2App device link and dynamic QR code and shows it to the end user. The dynamic QR code must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second. It is recommended that RP offers multiple options, QR image and Web2App link, to the user at the same time if either: RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC, The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device, and might want to authenticate using a separate mobile device. NOTE The device link structure is similar for both same-device and cross-device flows. The differences between them are: The value of deviceLinkType is different (Web2App, App2App vs QR), same-device links do not have elapsedSeconds and should not be dynamically regenerated, the final representation of the link to the user is different (a clickable HTTPS link vs a dynamic QR code). IMPORTANT All values in the deviceLink are case-sensitive. The resulting deviceLink must match bit by bit with the expected deviceLink in the Smart-ID backend. There must not be URL encoding in the deviceLink. There must not be URL fragment (#) in the deviceLink. The order of the path parameters in the device link must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; in QR flows, initialCallbackUrl must be included as an empty field; in same-device flows, elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink.

Only used in cross-device flows (dynamic QR code). lang An ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It should match the language that the user was seeing in the RP UI previously. This only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. authCode Calculated using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, using sessionSecret as the key, authCodePayload as the payload, and represented in Base64URL encoding. Explained in a separate page. IMPORTANT The calculation of device links must be performed in the RP backend. All values (including elapsedSeconds) must all be generated in the RP backend and the RP frontend must not be able to change or affect these parameters. For dynamic QR code flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to leak the sessionSecret parameter. Also, it is forbidden to generate values of authCode parameter ahead of time and forward them to the RP frontend/app. version parameter is a pre-defined value. Currently, only 1.0 is supported. It must be used in string form in device links. Example 6. version parameter \"1.0\" RP API returns sessionToken. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 7. sessionToken parameter \"wGIrqveE6AuGDATZKmR1mtAZ\" The parameter deviceLinkType describes the device link type: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 8. deviceLinkType parameter \"QR\" The parameter sessionType describes the session type: auth - for authentication session, sign - for signature session, cert - for certificate-choice session. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 9. sessionType parameter \"auth\" The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial session creation request to RP API. Notice that dynamic QR code link must be re-calculated each second because the elapsedSeconds value changes. elapsedSeconds value must be converted to string value to be used in QR code links: elapsedSeconds := TO-STRING(elapsedSeconds) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby public class Int2Str { public static void main(String[] args) { int elapsedSeconds = 22; String elapsedSecondsStr = Integer.toString(elapsedSeconds); System.out.println(elapsedSecondsStr); } } <?php $elapsedSeconds = 22; $elapsedSecondsStr = strval($elapsedSeconds); echo $elapsedSecondsStr; ?> elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = str(elapsed_seconds) print(elapsed_seconds_str) package main import ( \"fmt\" \"strconv\" ) func main() { var elapsedSeconds int = 22 var elapsedSecondsStr string = strconv.Itoa(elapsedSeconds) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", elapsedSecondsStr) } fn main() { let elapsed_seconds: i32 = 22; let elapsed_seconds_str: String = elapsed_seconds.to_string(); println!(\"{}\", elapsed_seconds_str) } fun main() { val elapsedSeconds: Int = 22 val elapsedSecondsStr: String = elapsedSeconds.toString() println(elapsedSecondsStr) } using System; public class Int2Str { public static void Main() { int elapsedSeconds = 22; string elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.ToString(); Console.WriteLine(elapsedSecondsStr); } } let elapsedSeconds = 22; let elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.toString(); console.log(elapsedSecondsStr); elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = elapsed_seconds.to_s puts elapsed_seconds_str Example 10. elapsedSeconds parameter \"22\" The lang parameter defines the interface language for the HTTPS fallback page that is shown to the user when there are technical problems regarding opening device links (for example, if user’s browser does not support Web2App links and needs to be configured to allow them or if Smart-ID app is not installed on the phone). Its format must be ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It is recommended that for consistent user experience, RP provides here the same language that the user was already using in the RP UI. This parameter only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. Example 11. lang parameter \"eng\" authCode parameter generation is explained in detail in authCode calculation page. The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters involved in device link construction should be accessible by which parties (see legend below). The table also includes parameters which are used for authCode calculation (e.g. unprotectedDeviceLink)--for their descriptions, see authCode calculation page. RP API server RP backend RP frontend/app version sessionID sessionToken sessionSecret deviceLinkType sessionType signatureProtocol rpChallenge digest relyingPartyName brokeredRpName interactions initialCallbackUrl unprotectedDeviceLink elapsedSeconds authCode lang Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - does not know parameter - MUST NOT know parameter For cases when the app is not installed or some other problem occurs with opening a device link, a fallback HTTPS webpage is opened with instructions on how to resolve the issue. The lang parameter in the link is by default used to show the same language as on the RP UI. The instructions cover the following scenarios: User is not on a mobile device where Smart-ID app is installed and has been allowed by the RP to use a wrong type of device link (e.g. a same-device link on a PC). Smart-ID App is not installed on the current device. Mobile browser does not support universal links / Android App links. Mobile OS/browser settings disallow the link and user intervention is required. For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW or MEDIUM should be used. HIGH cannot be used due to the typical device link length. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal block size for QR code is 6-10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues, although many will not). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning and take up too much space. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. QR code can be generated on the client or server. It is recommended to use the SVG format as it remains sharp when users zoom the page. Note that many QR code libraries that support SVG output do not accept block size as an input parameter. So, block size should be estimated based on overall image dimensions, device link length and error correction level. See QR generator section for an example which also calculates the resulting block size in pixels. IMPORTANT The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, however the link itself must only be generated by the RP backend. This is because sensitive parameters such as sessionSecret must never be sent to the RP frontend. This form allows to test different QR code sizes with the recommended parameters and estimate the block size in pixels.

Added device link based interaction flows (QR code, Web2App, App2App) for authentication, signing, and certificate-choice. Added distinct API endpoints for device link and notification based flows. Example: /v3/authentication/device-link/…​ vs. /v3/authentication/notification/…​ App2App and Web2App device link flows include a mandatory initialCallbackUrl parameter. It is used to construct the final callback URL to which the end-user is redirected after a successful PIN entry. Added new signature protocols: ACSP_V2 (Authentication Context Signing Protocol) RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE (signing pre-computed digests) Added capability to link a device link based certificate-choice request to a subsequent notification based signature request via /v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number}. Added an endpoint /v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} to request signing certificates when document number is know. This means that certificate-choice should only be used now before signature sessions in cases where document number is not know (e.g., no prior Smart-ID authentication). To prevent replay attacks, the mandatory rpChallenge parameter (an RP-generated random value) has been introduced for all initial v3 requests, effectively replacing the nonce parameter used in v2. The RSASSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signature padding scheme has been removed and is replaced by RSASSA-PSS, which is now the only supported option for RSA signatures. This change includes support for SHA-3 hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512) with RSASSA-PSS. Revised Verification Code (VC) generation for notification flows: Authentication flows: VC is derived from rpChallenge. Signing flows: VC is randomly generated by the Smart-ID API server. Introduced a possibility for new verification code formats in the future. For now, the existing format (four numbers) will still be the only option. App2App and Web2App device link flows now require callback verification process as part of the response verification process. The certificatechoice (v2) functionality is now certificate-choice (v3). It has been moved to /v3/signature/certificate-choice/…​. It now also supports device link based flows. The allowedInteractionsOrder parameter has been renamed to interactions, and its value (a JSON array of objects) must now be Base64 encoded. The standalone interaction type verificationCodeChoice has been removed. Use confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice instead for flows that require a verification code choice. The RP API server now provides the device link base URL to RPs. The session status response (GET /session/{sessionID}) now includes userChallenge and flowType. Added interactionTypeUsed to v3 responses. Added new session result.endResult status codes: USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION PROTOCOL_FAILURE SERVER_ERROR USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION replaced previous result.endResult status codes (the used interaction type is now provided separately): USER_REFUSED_DISPLAYTEXTANDPIN USER_REFUSED_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE_WITH_VC_CHOICE Uses v2 instead of v1 in URL, {rp-api-baseurl}/v2/ instead of {rp-api-baseurl}/v1/. Introduced allowedInteractionsOrder parameter to authentication and signing requests which replaces displayText and requestProperties.vcChoice parameters.

All messages are encoded using UTF-8. All requests only support HTTP/1.1, as described in RFC 2616. Normally, all positive responses are returned with HTTP status code 200. In some cases, 400 series error codes are used, those cases are described per request. All 500 series error codes indicate some kind of fatal server error. Smart-ID RP API returns different error codes for different error cases. However, to prevent data mining the RPs must not show different UI messages for those cases and make enumeration attacks more difficult. In cases where the user does not have an account, HTTP status code 404 is returned by the RP API. This could be caused by the user entering wrong ID code. It is recommended that RPs verify the user ID code checksums when possible to catch these errors. Whenever an RP session creation request (POST to signature/certificate-choice/ or signature/) is repeated inside a 15-second timeframe with exactly the same parameters, session ID of an existing session can be returned as a result. This allows to retry RP POST requests in case of communication errors. When the caller wants, it can override the idempotent behaviour inside this timeframe using an optional nonce parameter present for signature/certificate-choice and signature POST requests. Normally, that parameter can be omitted. IMPORTANT Providing nonce parameter is not allowed for authentication requests, since each authentication request must provide a randomly generated value for rpChallenge, making each authentication request already unique. RP API clients are authenticated based on their originating IP-address and relyingPartyUUID protocol parameter combinations. When authentication fails, server responds with HTTP error 401. relyingPartyName request field is case-insensitive and must match one of the names configured for the calling RP. The names are UTF-8 encoded and are displayed to the user in the Smart-ID application. The Smart-ID service reserves the right to add new fields into responses of the current RP API version. Therefore, the RP must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response objects at any location within the JSON structure. It is essential that RP client performs all the required checks when connecting to the Smart-ID RP API HTTPS endpoint, to make sure that the connection endpoint is authentic and that the connection is secure. This is required to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for the authentication and signature protocols. The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS cipher suite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint is valid (not expired, signed by trusted CA and not revoked). In case the RP fails to verify the connection is genuine and secure an attacker might be able to launch a MITM attack on the connection and either login as the user or have the user sign a forged document.","title":"API technical description","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.6","name":"api_details","url":"/rp-api/3.1.6/api_details.html","titles":[{"text":"HTTP status codes","hash":"_http_status_codes","id":1},{"text":"Error responses","hash":"_error_responses","id":2},{"text":"Idempotent behaviour","hash":"_idempotent_behaviour","id":3},{"text":"Interface authentication","hash":"_interface_authentication","id":4},{"text":"API client must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response object","hash":"_api_client_must_ignore_unknown_names_fields_in_json_response_object","id":5},{"text":"RP API endpoint authentication","hash":"_rp_api_endpoint_authentication","id":6}]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"Smart-ID app can support different interaction types and a Relying Party (RP) can demand a particular interaction with or without a fallback possibility. Different interactions can support different amount of data to display information to user. Each interaction is defined by an object that has 2 parameters: type and either displayText60 or displayText200. The following table shows interaction types available for each flow type. Linked notification based flow refers to the BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint. Interaction type & extra parameter Description Device link based flows Notification based flows Linked notification based flow displayTextAndPIN with displayText60 The simplest interaction with max 60 chars of text and PIN entry on a single screen. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessage with displayText200 First screen is for text only (max 200 chars) and has Confirm and Cancel buttons. Second screen is for PIN. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice with displayText200 First screen combines text and Verification Code choice. Second screen is for PIN. No Yes No All three interactions types are currently supported by all the clients. RP uses interactions parameter to list interactions it allows for the current session. New interaction types may be introduced in the future. However, it takes some time until all apps have been updated and are actually capable of displaying the new types. After introduction of a new interaction type both the new interaction type as a well as an older type should be provided in the array for clients that have not been yet updated. The interactions parameter is a Base64 encoded JSON array and the order of the items is significant. Each interaction in the array is a JSON object consisting of the type, and either displayText60 or displayText200. The first interaction that is supported by a specific app installation will be used. The interaction that was used is always reported back to RP with interactionTypeUsed response parameter to the session request. If an app cannot support any interaction requested then the session is cancelled with reason code REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP. IMPORTANT The following requirements apply for the interaction object: For each interaction, the type and the corresponding displayText (either displayText60 or displayText200) parameters are mandatory. Meaning that each interaction must include a non-empty displayText60 or displayText200 parameter. It is forbidden to provide both displayText60 and displayText200 parameters. It is not allowed to have more than one interaction with the same type value. In addition, it is not allowed to list interaction types not meant for the flow (device link flow or notification based flow). JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional). Therefore, the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be stored and reused in all subsequent calculations. This is relevant for all device link flows, more specifically in: authCode calculation; ACSP_V2 digest calculation (authentication only) during response verification. Failing to meet the first 4 requirements above will result in an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request). Failing to follow the last recommendation can result in some dynamic link sessions failing. If authCode calculation returns a different value from what RP API calculates, then the device link will be rejected due to wrong authCode value. If ACSP_V2 digest is calculated incorrectly, a valid user authentication signature will appear to be invalid and RP will have to deny the authentication attempt. displayText is a short text string displayed to the user in the Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent screen. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Smart-ID to authenticate users calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use a different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. displayText value can only be set by the RP backend and phishing attacks can’t change it. This is why, it is recommended to use the displayText to alert users and show warnings if an attack is suspected. For more details, see Additional security measures page. The displayText60 and displayText200 parameters are used by the Smart-ID app to display text on the screen. The preferred way of writing displayText60 and displayText200 is to explain the action user is taking which the user is expected to confirm. The descriptions should be concise and specific allowing the user to verify the context of the operation quickly. A few examples: Logging in to internet banking Log in to mobile banking app Applying for a credit card application, 1000€ credit limit Signing document Contract.asice Transfer 1000€ to Jane Doe GB33BUKB20201555555555 Usually, the Relying Party name does not need to be part of the display text as the RP name parameter is always displayed to the user along with the display text. Before sending the RP API request, interactions array must be turned into a string and then Base64 encoded. The interactions JSON should be minified to lower the overhead.

ACSP_V2 Version 2 of the ACSP protocol. App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Authentication key pair (or authentication key) Key pair that is used to digitally authenticate a person. Certificate Authority (CA) An entity that issues certificates for Smart-ID account owners. Cross-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in a different device. These use cases are usually used with dynamic QR codes and notification flows. Key pair A Pair of keys that are required for digital signature scheme. There are two kinds of key pairs (or shortly, keys) in the Smart-ID system, authentication key pair and signature key pair. The word pair refers to the private and public keys of each key pair used in an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, here RSA. Mobile device A tablet computer or smartphone that runs a mobile device operating system (Apple iOS, Google Android). Person A natural person who uses the Smart-ID system to authenticate herself to an RP and to issue digital signatures requested by RP. Registration Authority (RA) An entity responsible for recording or verifying some or all of the information (particularly the identities of subjects) needed by a CA to issue certificates and CRLs and to perform other certificate management functions. Relying Party request A request from an RP that requires some kind of operation in the Smart-ID backend system. It may or may not create a transaction. Relying Party (RP) An organization or service, for example a bank, that uses the Smart-ID service to authenticate its users and to get them to sign the documents. Same-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in the same device. Signature key pair (or signature key) Key pair that is used to give digital signatures of a person. Smart-ID account A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID system. Account binds a Smart-ID app instance (installed on a person’s mobile device) to a person’s identity in the Smart-ID system. In the course of account creation and registration, the identity of the account owner (person) is proofed by a Registration Authority (RA) and the relation between the identity and a key pair is certified by a Certificate Authority (CA). An account has a signature key pair and an authentication key pair. Smart-ID app A technical component of the Smart-ID system. A mobile app instance installed on a person’s mobile device that provides access to Smart-ID functionality for persons. Smart-ID provider An organization that is legally responsible for the Smart-ID system. Smart-ID server A technical component of the Smart-ID system. Server-side counterpart of the Smart-ID app. Handles backend operations and provides API-s to Relying Party (RP). Smart-ID system A technical and organizational environment that enables digital authentication and issuing of digital signatures of persons in an electronic environment. The Smart-ID system provides services that allow persons (Smart-ID account owners) to authenticate themselves to RPs, to give digital signatures requested by RPs, and to manage their Smart-ID accounts. Users Natural persons with registered Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. Verification Code (VC) Verification codes are 4 numbers shown to the user for notification based (authentication and signature) flows to let the user bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures.

The first four are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fifth is a GET request used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The POST v3/authentication/* session endpoints are used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the POST v3/signature/* session endpoints are used to create digital signatures; the POST v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} endpoint is used to obtain the signing certificate of the requested document number; the POST v3/signature/certificate-choice/* session endpoints ([1], [2] and [3]) are used when the document number is not known immediately prior to the signature session and the user’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; finally, the GET v3/session/{sessionID} status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. The implementation details are described on the OpenAPI specification page. There are two types of flows that can be used in v3/authentication/*, v3/signature/* and v3/signature/certificate-choice/* sessions - the device link based flow and the notification based flow. NOTE In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only use device link based flows or only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a device link based flow beforehand. It is up to the RP to decide how to securely identify such devices/browsers and tie them to the user’s Smart-ID personal number by utilizing browser cookies, local app storage or other means. See additional security measures page for more details. There are different ways to reference users - via their issued identifier, a document number linking a specific account or even not at all (in case of anonymous device link based flows). The different object references are described on the OpenAPI specification page. IMPORTANT Once a user has been identified within a RP session, then in subsequent signing and certificate-choice requests the document-number reference should be used. The following diagram shows main authentication flows and which endpoints to use: The following diagram shows main signature flows and which endpoints to use: In order to authenticate a user, RPs must create a random challenge and use RP API to get user signature on it. Using the device link based flow is the most secure option and should be preferred. RP may call the anonymous device link based authentication session endpoint and display a dynamic QR code that the user must scan with the Smart-ID app or show a same-device (Web2App, App2App) link the user can interact with. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/anonymous Instead of using the anonymous authentication session endpoint, the RP may request the user to enter their user identifier and utilize the non-anonymous authentication session endpoint. This may be beneficial when the RP utilizes custom usernames and has the users' identifiers stored internally. The RP may simply always ask the user for the identifier as well. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint should be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/document/{document-number} Notification based authentication session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. Using a notification based authentication session endpoint triggers a push notification to all the user’s devices instead of the user scanning the QR code or clicking the same-device link. BASE/v3/authentication/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint can be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/notification/document/{document-number} In order to obtain an electronic signature of a document (ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES or PDF with PAdES), RPs must create the document structure themselves, calculate the hash, and use RP API to get user signature on it. Signing can be done in two ways—​with or without prior Smart-ID authentication. Where applicable and reasonable, Signing with prior authentication should be preferred. However, there are valid use cases for Signing without prior authentication. If a user has already logged onto the RP app or website using Smart-ID authentication, the RP can call the certificate session endpoint to obtain the user’s signing certificate. As the document number is attained from the preceding authentication call, no user interaction is required for obtaining the certificate and the RP API can immediately provide it. BASE/v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} The RP can then call the device link based signature session endpoint to sign using the same Smart-ID account that was used for authentication. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/document/{document-number} The notification based signature session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} If no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, signing request may be done directly. For this, a signing certificate is still most likely required to be obtained first (this is true for all use cases known in practice, e.g. ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES or PDF with PAdES). For obtaining the certificate and getting the user’s signature, the recommended way is to use the linked signing flow which is a new concept introduced in RP API v3. Linked signing flow consists of an anonymous device link based certificate-choice request followed by a notification based signing request. In case no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, and certificate is required, the anonymous device link based certificate-choice session endpoint should be used. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/device-link/anonymous Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must call the notification based linked signature session endpoint and provide the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter (session ID of the previous certificate-choice session) to connect the signature and certificate-choice sessions. BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number} The combination of device link based certificate-choice and notification based linked signature session endpoints provides the optimal user experience where Smart-ID app is launched only once and a verification code (VC) is not shown. If the certificate-choice session was completed using a same-device device link, then as the final step of the signing process, the Smart-ID app will launch the callbackUrl (which was provided in the device link based certificate-choice request that initiated the linked signing flow). The callbackUrl the user will end up will also have additional parameters as explained in Callback URLs page. NOTE In the flow described above, it is recommended to stop showing the QR code, Web2App or App2App link in the RP UI after the certificate is obtained. Notification based certificate-choice session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose but is not recommended. In this case, first use notification based certificate-choice session endpoint: BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must display the VC and call notification based signature session endpoint. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} IMPORTANT Notification based certificate-choice cannot be connected to notification based linked signature session endpoint with linkedSessionID. If notification based certificate-choice is used, verification code (VC) must still be shown to the user, and in same-device use cases, there might be usability issues with VC being shown too fast or not being shown at all (this is especially problematic for interactions involving confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice). If the certificate is not required, the device link based signature session endpoint should be called instead. Essentially this means that it is acceptable that the end user gives the signature using any of the Smart-ID devices in their possession. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} NOTE There is no anonymous device link based signature session endpoint, since in all practical signing use cases the user’s identity is known beforehand.","title":"Overview of API endpoints","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.6","name":"overview_of_api_endpoints","url":"/rp-api/3.1.6/overview_of_api_endpoints.html","titles":[{"text":"Choosing which endpoints to use","hash":"_choosing_which_endpoints_to_use","id":1},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":2},{"text":"Device link based authentication","hash":"_device_link_based_authentication","id":3},{"text":"Notification based authentication","hash":"_notification_based_authentication","id":4},{"text":"Signing","hash":"_signing","id":5},{"text":"Signing with prior authentication","hash":"signing_with_prior_authentication","id":6},{"text":"Device link based signing with prior authentication","hash":"_device_link_based_signing_with_prior_authentication","id":7},{"text":"Notification based signing with prior authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_with_prior_authentication","id":8},{"text":"Signing without prior authentication","hash":"signing_without_prior_authentication","id":9},{"text":"Linked signing (without prior authentication)","hash":"_linked_signing_without_prior_authentication","id":10},{"text":"Notification based signing without prior authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_without_prior_authentication","id":11},{"text":"Device link based signing without prior authentication and without certificate","hash":"_device_link_based_signing_without_prior_authentication_and_without_certificate","id":12}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"The Mock Service, also known as the Smart-ID Relying Party API version 3 automated testing interface, is a component of the Smart-ID demo environment. It simulates the behavior of a mobile device running the Smart-ID application, allowing RPs to test their Smart-ID integrations without the need for an actual phone or real user interaction. Instead of waiting for a user to interact with their device, the Mock Service automatically produces predefined outcomes such as a successful transaction, a cancelled transaction, or a timeout. When the RP sends a request to the Smart-ID demo environment, the Mock Service steps in to act as the “user” and completes the request with the result that corresponds to the document number provided in the request. All the steps that the RP does, such as creating the request, polling the results, and validating the returned signature, are exactly the same as they would be with actual mobile devices. From the RP’s point of view, the flow behaves as though a real end-user had taken part in the transaction. The Mock Service can be used in two main ways: through the notification flow and through the device link–based flow. In both cases, the RP follows the same sequence of actions as in production, with the only difference being that the user’s mobile device is replaced by the Mock Service. The notification flow is the most straightforward, where the Smart-ID Core communicates directly with the mobile app. With device link–based flows introduced in RP API v3, the user is expected to interact with a device link that opens the Smart-ID app. Device links can appear in different forms: a QR code scanned by the user, a Web2App link clicked in a browser on the same device, or an App2App link opened from another mobile application. The Mock Service provides simulation for all of these cases, ensuring that RPs can test every supported scenario in the demo environment. Each document number corresponds to a specific result type. For instance, one document number may consistently provide a successful authentication, while another may always produce an error or a timeout. When a RP submits a request to the RP API using one of these document numbers, the Service retrieves the number, identifies the associated outcome, and responds accordingly. In the Notification based flow, the Mock Service operates exactly like an actual mobile device. RP initiates a request, indicating one of the preconfigured document numbers, and the Service delivers the corresponding mapped result. Then, the RP polls for the transaction outcome and proceeds with validation as if the process had been executed on a real device. The Device link flow requires one additional step compared to the notification flow. Unlike the notification flow, where Core communicates directly with the mobile application, the device link flow requires the RP to generate and handle a special type of URL known as a device link. This link is then delivered to the user, who normally interacts with it on their device, which in turn opens the Smart-ID app. To achieve this flow in the demo environment, the Mock Service requires the RP to simulate the user interaction. When the RP creates a device link request, it first receives three values from the RP API: sessionId, sessionToken, and sessionSecret. In the production, these would be bound to the device link opened by the user. In the demo environment, RP must send these values to the Mock Service through the device-link endpoint. This step simulates the user clicking or scanning the device link and guarantees that the Service can continue with the simulation of the outcome. After this link has been “used”, the Mock Service finalizes the transaction and generates the mapped result. In the Web2App and App2App flows, there is an additional step that occurs after the user has entered their PIN in Smart-ID app - the user is automatically re-directed to RP’s website or app. To replicate this in the demo environment, the Mock Service processes the signing or authentication request and performs a GET request to the Callback URL supplied by the RP. It includes the appropriate cookies and additional parameters, such as the userChallengeVerifier and sessionSecretDigest, which the RP would normally receive from the real application.","title":"Mock Service","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.6","name":"mock_service","url":"/rp-api/3.1.6/mock_service.html","titles":[{"text":"How to use","hash":"_how_to_use","id":1},{"text":"Notification flow","hash":"_notification_flow","id":2},{"text":"Device link flow","hash":"_device_link_flow","id":3},{"text":"Same-Device Flows (Web2App and App2App)","hash":"_same_device_flows_web2app_and_app2app","id":4}]},"71":{"id":71,"text":"Notification based flows are flows that rely on the push notification mechanism to notify the Smart-ID app. In these flows, the RP website or app shows a verification code (VC) which the user must compare to the VC displayed on Smart-ID to match the authentication or signature session. To force the user to perform the verification, the RP can request the Smart-ID app to display three VCs (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code which is displayed by the RP website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice interaction type. For details of the interactions object, see Interactions page. TIP In case of same-device use cases where the recommended App2App or Web2App device link flow cannot be used for some reason, then in notification flows it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app before the push notification arrives. Below, sequence diagrams are given along with explanations of the differences. The following diagram describes the notification based flow for the authentication session. The following sequence diagram illustrates the notification based signing flow. The following sequence diagram illustrates the device link based certificate choice flow being linked to a notification based signing flow. There are separate signing protocols for authentication and signature requests (see signature protocols for details). In RP API v3 notification based authentication requests, RP must compute verification codes (VC) for each authentication request, so the user can bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. The VC is computed as follows: Calculate SHA-256 from the rpChallenge, extract 2 rightmost bytes from the result, interpret them as a big-endian unsigned integer and take the last 4 digits in decimal form for display. SHA-256 must be used to calculate the VC. Please keep in mind that the rpChallenge is the real rpChallenge byte value (for example, the byte array returned from the SecureRandom() or equivalent method), not the Base64 encoded form used for transport or the popular hexadecimal representation. The VC value must be displayed to the user in the browser together with a message asking the end user to verify the code matches with the one displayed on their mobile device. The user must not proceed if these don’t match. integer(SHA-256(rpChallenge)[-2:-1]) mod 10000 Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.math.BigInteger; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.security.MessageDigest; import java.util.Base64; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode( rpChallengeBase64 ); MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); md.update(rpChallengeBytes); byte[] sha256Hash = md.digest(); BigInteger LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK = new BigInteger(\"65535\"); BigInteger result = new BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(new BigInteger(\"10000\")); String verificationCode = String.format(\"%04d\", result); System.out.println(verificationCode); } } <?php $rpChallengeBase64 = base64_decode('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg=='); $sha256Hash = hash('sha256', $rpChallengeBase64, true); $result = hexdec(bin2hex(substr($sha256Hash, -2))) % 10000; $verificationCode = sprintf('%04d', $result); echo $verificationCode; ?> import base64 import hashlib rp_challenge_base64 = b\"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" rp_challenge_bytes = base64.b64decode(rp_challenge_base64) sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(rp_challenge_bytes).digest() result = int.from_bytes(sha256_hash[-2:], byteorder='big') % 10000 verification_code = f\"{result:04d}\" print(verification_code) package main import ( \"crypto/sha256\" \"encoding/base64\" \"fmt\" ) func main() { var rpChallengeBase64 string = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" var rpChallengeBytes, err = base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(rpChallengeBase64) if err != nil { panic(err) } var sha256Hash [32]byte = sha256.Sum256(rpChallengeBytes) var result int = int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-2])<<8 + int(sha256Hash[len(sha256Hash)-1]) result %= 10000 var verificationCode string = fmt.Sprintf(\"%04d\", result) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\",verificationCode) } use base64::decode; use sha2::{Sha256, Digest}; fn main() { let rp_challenge_base64: &str = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; let rp_challenge_bytes = decode(rp_challenge_base64).unwrap(); let sha256_hash = Sha256::digest(&rp_challenge_bytes); let result = (((sha256_hash[30] as u16) << 8) + (sha256_hash[31] as u16)) % 10000; let verification_code: String = format!(\"{:04}\", result); println!(\"{}\", verification_code); } import java.math.BigInteger import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets import java.security.MessageDigest import java.util.Base64 fun main() { val rpChallengeBase64: String = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" val rpChallengeBytes: ByteArray = Base64.getDecoder().decode(rpChallengeBase64) val sha256Hash: ByteArray = MessageDigest .getInstance(\"SHA-256\") .digest(rpChallengeBytes) val LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK: BigInteger = BigInteger(\"65535\") val result: BigInteger = BigInteger(sha256Hash) .and(LAST_2_BYTES_BITMASK) .mod(BigInteger(\"10000\")) val verificationCode = \"%04d\".format(result) println(verificationCode) } using System; using System.Security.Cryptography; public class NotificationVerificationCode { public static void Main(string[] args) { string rpChallengeBase64 = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\"; byte[] rpChallengeBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(rpChallengeBase64); using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create()) { byte[] sha256Hash = sha256.ComputeHash(rpChallengeBytes); int result = ((sha256Hash[30] << 8) + (sha256Hash[31])) % 10000; string verificationCode = result.ToString(\"D4\"); Console.WriteLine(verificationCode); } } } const crypto = require('crypto'); const rpChallenge = Buffer.from('GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==', 'base64'); const sha256 = crypto.createHash('sha256'); sha256.update(rpChallenge); const sha256Hash = sha256.digest(); const result = sha256Hash.readUInt16BE(30) % 10000 .toString() .padStart(4, '0'); console.log(result); require 'base64' require 'digest' rp_challenge = \"GYS+yoah6emAcVDNIajwSs6UB/M95XrDxMzXBUkwQJ9YFDipXXzGpPc7raWcuc2+TEoRc7WvIZ/7dU/iRXenYg==\" sha256_hash = Digest::SHA256.digest(Base64.decode64(rp_challenge)) last_2_bytes = sha256_hash[-2..-1].unpack('n*').first result = (last_2_bytes % 10_000).to_s.rjust(4, '0') puts result Example 1.

The digest is calculated over the ACSP_V2_payload, and ACSP_V2_payload is assembled using vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator. Rules of generating the digest value: in case initialCallbackUrl does not exist (for QR and Notification flows), this field must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in case the RP is not acting as a broker, the brokeredRpName must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; interactions must be the same Base64-encoded byte string value that was used to initiate the session. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), trying to encode the same object again might return a different value; the digest must be calculated from UTF-8 encoded byte array that consists of the described elements joined in the specified order with vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator, this also applies to Base64 encoded values, they must be used as is without Base64 decoding; Base64 encoding must also make sure that the unused bits are set to 0 and that the resulting values are correctly padded with = signs; the hash algorithm to use is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters.hashAlgorithm.

RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE is a signature protocol where a pre-calculated digest (hash) of the data-to-be-signed is sent in the initial request, and the digital signature is generated directly on this provided digest. For verification, the digest itself or the complete original data that corresponds to the digest must be used. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signatureProtocol and signatureProtocolParameters parameters in the signature requests and examples, see the API spec signature request parameters. The digest value sent with the initial RP request is the digest value of the data-to-be-signed. One of the supported hash algorithms must be used. The signature is directly generated on the digest value and the verification must be done using the data-to-be-signed. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature parameter in the signature response and examples, see the API spec session status response parameters. Full verification of the signature and response is described in Response verification. NOTE When integrating with Smart-ID RP API for electronic signing, note that RP API v3 and above only supports RSASSA-PSS signature scheme. Previous versions supported only the legacy RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme. Some national signature container formats do not support RSASSA-PSS and if alternatives are not available (such as the ASiC format that is internationally recognized), previous RP API versions might have to be used to obtain RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signatures.","title":"Signature protocols","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.6","name":"signature_protocols","url":"/rp-api/3.1.6/signature_protocols.html","titles":[{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature protocol","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_protocol","id":1},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature request parameters","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_request_parameters","id":2},{"text":"rpChallenge generation","hash":"_rpchallenge_generation","id":3},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature response parameters","hash":"_acsp_v2_signature_response_parameters","id":4},{"text":"ACSP_V2 digest calculation","hash":"acsp_v2_digest_calculation","id":5},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol","hash":"raw_digest_signature_protocol","id":6},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters","hash":"raw_digest_signature_request_parameters","id":7},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE digest value","hash":"raw_digest_signature_digest_calculation","id":8},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature response parameters","hash":"_raw_digest_signature_signature_response_parameters","id":9}]},"73":{"id":73,"text":"After receiving the transaction response from the session status API call the following algorithm must be used to decide if the authentication result is trustworthy and what the identity of the authenticating end user is, if the signature result is valid. In App2App and Web2App flows, the response verification step must be performed after the user has returned via the callback URL, as described in Callback URLs page. The following steps perform the response verification algorithm. Note that the algorithm is applicable to both authentication and signature session flows. Specific differences, such as the conditional execution of Steps 1 and 3, are noted within the steps. Session secret verification (applicable only for sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Base64 decode the sessionSecret string received in the initial request. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the Base64 decoded sessionSecret value. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Obtain the sessionSecretDigest value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the sessionSecretDigest obtained from the callback URL. Initial session response check: Verify the state field in the JSON response is exactly COMPLETE. Verify the result.endResult field is exactly OK. Verify the signatureProtocol field is exactly ACSP_V2 in case of authentication or RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE in case of signature. Ensure the cert, signature, and result objects are present and not null. User challenge verification (applicable only for authentication sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Obtain the userChallengeVerifier value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the received userChallengeVerifier string. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the signature.userChallenge string provided in the JSON response’s signature object. Certificate Chain Validation and Trust: Decode the Base64 encoded end-entity certificate string from cert.value and parse it into a standard X.509 certificate representation. The RP API provides only the end-entity certificate, the Relying Party must have the necessary root and intermediate CA certificates configured locally to allow the library to build the full certificate chain. For these certificates, see Certificates page. Using a standard cryptographic library, initiate the validation of the certificate chain starting from the end-entity certificate. Provide the end-entity certificate to the library, along with configuring it with the set of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors). It’s important to note that some libraries use the system certificate store in addition to the provided CA certificates, this should be disabled and only the explicitly configured CA certificates should be used. For each certificate in the constructed chain (end-entity certificate and all intermediate CA certificates), perform the following checks. A standard cryptographic library will typically perform the following checks as part of its overall chain validation routine and report the result as a success or failure. Verify the certificate’s digital signature using the public key of its issuer certificate. Verify the certificate’s validity period against the current time, i.e., not before the notBefore date and not after the notAfter date. Verify that the certificate has not been revoked. This check should be performed using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), utilizing the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension within the certificate to locate the OCSP responder URL. If OCSP fails or is unavailable, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking should be used as fallback. Note: Revocation checks (OCSP/CRL) are not performed on self-signed root CA certificates configured as trust anchors. Intermediate CA certificates can be revoked and must be checked. Note: OCSP responses are digitally signed. The certificate chain of the OCSP responder itself should also be verified, ensuring it is trusted and authorized to provide status for the certificate being checked. Verify basic constraints are appropriate: Intermediate CA certificates must have the Basic Constraints extension present with the cA boolean set to TRUE. For end-entity certificates, the Basic Constraints extension should either absent, or if present, its cA boolean should be set to FALSE. Smart-ID Scheme Identification (End-Entity Certificate): Before checking specific purposes, verify that the end-entity certificate belongs to the Smart-ID scheme. Examine the Certificate Policies extension of the end-entity certificate. The certificate must contain all the specific policy OIDs designated by SK ID Solutions for the Smart-ID scheme (as defined in Chapter 2.2.3 of the \"Certificate and OCSP Profile for Smart-ID\" in Certificate Profiles page). These OIDs differentiate Smart-ID certificates from other types of certificates (e.g., Mobile-ID, Estonian ID-card). The Relying Party must consult the current official SK ID Solutions Certificate Policies for the definitive list of Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs. For these certificate policies, see Certificate Policies page. If not all the recognized Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs are present, the certificate should not be processed as a Smart-ID certificate, and the verification should fail for this context. End-Entity Certificate Purpose Validation (Smart-ID Context): Examine the end-entity certificate for extensions and attributes required by the certificate profile. For these certificate profiles, see Certificate Profiles page. For Smart-ID authentication: To confirm the certificate is suitable for authentication, it must contain one of the following: The digitalSignature key usage and the Smart-ID authentication (1.3.6.1.4.1.62306.5.7.0) Extended Key Usage which is present in certificates issued April 2025 onwards. The digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment key usages and the id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) Extended Key Usage which is found in older, still valid certificates issued before April 2025. For digital signing: Check for appropriate key usage nonRepudiation. Assurance Level Check: Extract the assurance level string from cert.certificateLevel (e.g., ADVANCED, QUALIFIED). For qualified certificates, check that the extension values as defined by the certificate profile exist within the certificate from cert.value. Compare this level against the minimum assurance level required by the RP for the specific context or transaction. Ensure the certificate’s level meets or exceeds the required level (note that ADVANCED < QUALIFIED). Identity Match Check: Extract the authenticated user’s identifier from the end-entity certificate. For Smart-ID certificates serialNumber (OID 2.5.4.5) under Subject DN contain the national identity code, for example PNOEE-30001010004. If the RP initiated the authentication or signing for a specific known user, verify that the extracted identifier matches the expected identity for that session. Verification of signature Object (authentication/signature session): Only for authentication session: Reconstruct the exact ACSP_V2_payload string that was signed, as described under ACSP_V2 digest calculation. This is done by concatenating the fields in order, separated by the vertical bar character | (U+007C): 'smart-id'|'ACSP_V2'|serverRandom|rpChallenge|userChallenge|BASE64(relyingPartyName)|BASE64(brokeredRpName)|BASE64(SHA-256(interactions))|interactionTypeUsed|initialCallbackUrl|flowType Only for signature session: Use the data-to-be-signed, a digest of which was initially sent when initiating the signature session (as described in RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol). Decode the signature value from signature.value using Base64 decoding. Obtain the public key from the parsed end-entity user certificate (from Step 4). Only for authentication session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against the UTF-8 bytes of the reconstructed ACSP_V2_payload string. Only for signature session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against either the data-to-be-signed or the hash of the data-to-be-signed (there are libraries that provide options for either). Ensure the verification uses the algorithm specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm (e.g., rsassa-pss) and correctly applies the parameters from signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters (e.g., hash algorithm like SHA-512, MGF1 hash like SHA-512, salt length like 64, and the trailer field 0xbc). Session Management (Only for authentication sessions. Important: only perform if all the preceding steps (1-9) were successful): Invalidate any previous, unauthenticated session identifier associated with the user’s interaction (e.g., browser cookie or API token used before successful authentication). Generate a new, secure, and unique session identifier representing the now authenticated state. Associate the authenticated user’s identity (from Step 8) and potentially the assurance level (from Step 7) with this new session identifier in your server-side session store. After a successful action, the users should be able to view their actions or download the signed document.

IMPORTANT If Web2App and App2App flows are used by the same RP, the initialCallbackUrl base (without the random parameter) must be different for both flows, otherwise Web2App flow callbackUrl might wrongly end up in the RP app. For Web2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP website. RP website backend has to set a session cookie to the user’s browser. This cookie must be set as SameSite=Lax because later, the Smart-ID app will launch the callback URL using top-level navigation and the request type will be GET. RP website backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP website backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL address of RP website and their browser will have the same session cookie. Some aspects to take into account are: User will end up on a new browser tab; The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP website sends the callback URL to RP website backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP website backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session cookie matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; Verify that the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret equals to sessionSecretDigest in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. callbackUrl must be invalidated after use and must not be accepted after it is used once. Failing to invalidate the callbackUrl after use may leave the user vulnerable to a phishing attack. Redirect the user to a new page and show authenticated session. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. In cases where user initiated the authentication/signing flow on a mobile browser that was not their default browser, the HTTPS callback URL will probably be opened in the default browser which will not have the session cookie and thus the verification must fail. The protocol steps for handling App2App callback URLs are functionally the same as for Web2App; however, there are also some differences in the steps below due to fundamental differences between webpages and apps. For App2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP app. RP app has to save a session identifier in the app’s storage. RP app backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP app backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL, which will cause RP app to open (for this to work, RP app has to be configured to handle that domain and path of the URL). The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP app sends the callback URL together with the session identifier from storage to RP app backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP app backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session identifier matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; Verify that the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret equals to sessionSecretDigest in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. callbackUrl must be invalidated after use and must not be accepted after it is used once. Failing to invalidate the callbackUrl after use may leave the user vulnerable to a phishing attack. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. Linked notification based flows are used in cases where the certificate of the user is required before the digest to be signed can be generated. In these flows callbackUrl is required and it is supplied by the RP in the initial device link based certificate choice request. However, the callbackUrl is not immediately used after the certificate choice request, and is only used after the /v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint is called with the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter and the flow is completed. If the initial callback URL provided by RP backend is: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ then in the authentication flow the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc&userChallengeVerifier=XtPfaGa8JnGtYrJjboooUf0KfY9sMEHrWFpSQrsUv9c In the signature and certificate-choice flows the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc For both Web2App and App2App callback URLs, the checks described above provide complete phishing resistance. Always prefer device link flows if possible.

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases: authentication and digital signing. Smart-ID is a secure digital identity service that enables users to authenticate and create digital signatures using their mobile device. The service works through a collaboration between: Relying Parties (RPs) - organizations that need to verify user identity or obtain digital signatures Smart-ID service - the backend infrastructure that manages authentication and signing processes Smart-ID mobile app - the user’s interface for confirming transactions The typical Smart-ID workflow follows these steps: A user wants to authenticate or sign a document with a Relying Party The RP creates a session by calling the Smart-ID RP API with either: A challenge (for authentication) A document hash (for digital signing) The user interacts with Smart-ID through one of these methods: Scanning a dynamic QR code (cross-device) Clicking a link (same-device) Receiving a push notification The user verifies transaction details and confirms the transaction in the Smart-ID app The Smart-ID service generates the digital signature The RP receives the result and validates the user’s certificate The latest version introduces device link flows--a unified approach for cross-device and same-device scenarios. Device link flows provide a modern and more secure alternative to push notification flows. Device link—​a unified approach for cross-device and same-device scenarios Users scan dynamic QR codes when the RP session is on a different device than their Smart-ID app (e.g., using a PC browser to access an RP website). Cross-device device link flow Users click device links when the RP frontend (website or app) is on the same mobile device as their Smart-ID app: Web2App - to navigate from RP website to Smart-ID app; App2App - to navigate from RP app to Smart-ID app. Same-device device link flow Unified Flow: All flows share the same API endpoints and security mechanisms despite different launch methods Flexible Integration: RPs can offer multiple authentication methods simultaneously Enhanced Security: Device link flows provide better protection than notification-based flows RP API v3 still has notification based flows that are very similar to previous versions of the RP API. Users enter their identity code. They then receive a notification on their device(s). Notification based flow When integrating RP API v3, every RP has to make a choice between using device links, notification-based flows, or a combination of them. Essentially, there are three possible options: Always use device links Use device links once on a new device, and use push notifications on known devices Always use push notifications This choice should be done after careful consideration to ensure that RP and its users obtain maximum possible security and user experience benefits. The following table gives an overview of the possible options and their implications.

Available options for implementing the cross-device flow. For same-device use cases, the same security considerations apply as for the cross-device use cases. However, there are even more benefits for always using device link flows in the same-device use case: they provide a seamless user experience, where user has to only make one click to open up the Smart-ID app; user does not have to verify verification codes (which can be problematic for users to verify in same-device flows); they provide highest phishing resistance possible, relying on the fact that RP frontend and Smart-ID app reside in the same device.

Available options for implementing the same-device flow. Although Smart-ID service is a technology designed with security in mind, Relying Parties (RPs) need to consider potential risks which are associated with digital authentication and signing solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users understand the context of their actions and protect them from possible attacks. Throughout this integration guide, we describe effective security measures for mitigating attacks, however not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the RP’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Throughout this guide, the following types of information blocks are used: IMPORTANT Important blocks contain critical information that must be followed without exception. Ignoring them may lead to security issues or implementation failures. NOTE Note blocks provide additional information and clarify implementation details. TIP Tip blocks describe optional features and provide additional information that can be used to enhance your implementation. To understand the technical details of the solution, start by reading the Overview of API endpoints. For additional information about device link flows, continue to read the Device Link flows page.

Commonly Smart-ID is used together with national identity numbers, however these national identity numbers might not be secret and could be enumerated. A better approach is to use anonymous device links which require the user to initiate the authentication process. If the anonymous device links can’t be used for some reason, then the RP may ask for national identity number and a non-public identifier as well. This non-public identifier can be a username the users can choose, the account contract number or something else only the user knows. A useful security measure is to keep track of trusted browser instances for each user. This allows the RP to take different actions whenever the user is connecting from their usual (trusted) browser or attempting to log in from a previously unseen, unknown browser. In case of the latter, an attacker may be attempting a phishing attack and the RP could ask for more information or alert the user. IMPORTANT Using the User-Agent field for device/browser identification is not secure and should be avoided as it can be easily spoofed by a malicious party. The following are recommendations for setting up tracking for trusted and unknown browsers: The tracking must be done with an HTTP cookie (or with similar client-side storage features supported by modern browsers) with the content of randomly generated identifier (trackingID). The fact about placing such a cookie in the browser of the user must be declared in the public cookie policy. The RP database must keep previously seen browsers with the randomly generated identifier hash (hashedTrackingID), and the RP may allow the user to edit the names of the known browsers. The browser cookie must be set with Secure and HttpOnly flags, and the scope of the cookie must be the URL of the RP’s website. The RP website or app must allow the user to invalidate all the cookies on the RP server. A simple algorithm to set the hashedTrackingID for the user and browser combination can be used: If a valid trackingID is not present, and authentication succeeds, set the trackingID and save it in the database for the particular user’s personal number and browser combination. If a valid trackingID for the particular user and browser combination is present, the browser can be trusted. Additional security measures can be used if a new connection from an unknown browser is made, such as: asking for the user’s national identity number, sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from an unknown browser. Are you using a new computer?\". When a user connects to the RP’s website or the app, it connects from the IP address of the user’s device. In case an attacker makes the connection or in case the attacker proxies the connection, the RP will see the attacker’s or proxy’s IP address. There are commercial services that can provide general information about IP addresses. For example, they can tell if the IP address is known to be used for: sending spam messages, which may indicate the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer, is known to be an open HTTP proxy host, which may indicate that the user connecting from such an IP address might be using a compromised computer or that an attacker might be using this host to proxy their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be used as a TOR exit node or an anonymizing VPN service, which may indicate that the attacker could be using this to hide their connection to the RP’s website or the app, is known to be an IP address of a hosting provider, data-centre or content delivery network, which may indicate that the requests might be used to perform denial-of-service or data mining attacks. In addition to such commercial services, RP’s own incident resolution team or security monitoring team could provide a list of IP addresses that are related to known incidents or suspicious activities. Additional security measures can be used if the IP address is determined to be suspicious, such as: sending an email or notification alert to the user, using a different displayText for the authentication session such as \"Authentication started from a suspicious IP address. Are you authenticating to https://rp.example.com?\", performing a CAPTCHA verification, block connections from malicious IP addresses. It is important to give the user an option to see the history of their actions. For example when the user logged in, what operations the user has executed, what orders the user has placed and so on. This provides the user visibility and transparency about what is happening on their account. It also provides an opportunity to see actions or operations the user doesn’t recognize and that could point to security incidents. RPs must allow the user to download digitally signed documents that were created after entering PIN2. This applies to any operation that uses PIN2 for additional consent. For example, after signing the terms and conditions for the e-service or when signing a transfer order on the RP’s website the user must be allowed to download the signed document. This allows the signer to verify contents of the signed document. RP should record enough information about connections and operations users regularly attempt on the RP’s website or app. It is then possible to apply log analysis and other security intelligence to the available information (and cross-reference with other data sources) to deduce with some certainty that: there is an ongoing attack; some source (IP address, browser, phone number, e-mail address) behaves in a weird way and perhaps should be more closely monitored or added to a blocklist; some logs might indicate that there’s an unknown vulnerability in the RP’s website. Procedures to respond to fraud and security incidents must be developed and communicated and practiced within the RP organization. The RP must be familiar with services and guidelines from law enforcement authorities and other bodies. It is useful to establish contacts with these organizations before the urgent need arises. Good opportunity to do that is to participate in exercise sessions with the local cyber defence league unit. Some security measures described in this document require processing additional data about users (for example, which IP addresses they have used) and require placing additional information on their browser cookies. This means that the RP must re-evaluate their personal data processing guidelines and public policies. Preferences cookies which are mentioned above for tracking trusted and unknown browsers require users' consent, and the information about using the cookie must be declared in the public cookie policy. For processing personal data, the RP must make sure that they have a lawful basis for doing so (see GDPR art 6(1)). In case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. It is also useful to review the RP’s privacy policy and update it with relevant information.","title":"Additional security measures","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"additional_security_measures","url":"/rp-api/additional_security_measures.html","titles":[{"text":"Anonymous flows and user identifiers","hash":"_anonymous_flows_and_user_identifiers","id":1},{"text":"Keeping track of trusted and unknown browsers","hash":"_keeping_track_of_trusted_and_unknown_browsers","id":2},{"text":"Keeping track of suspicious and malicious IP addresses","hash":"_keeping_track_of_suspicious_and_malicious_ip_addresses","id":3},{"text":"Allowing users to verify operations","hash":"allowing-users-to-verify-operations","id":4},{"text":"Monitoring usage patterns","hash":"_monitoring_usage_patterns","id":5},{"text":"Responding to security incidents","hash":"_responding_to_security_incidents","id":6},{"text":"Personal data processing","hash":"_personal_data_processing","id":7}]},"77":{"id":77,"text":"Relying Party API is exposed over a REST interface. All messages are encoded using UTF-8. All requests only support HTTP/1.1, as described in RFC 2616. Normally, all positive responses are returned with HTTP status code 200. In some cases, 400 series error codes are used, those cases are described per request. All 500 series error codes indicate some kind of fatal server error. Smart-ID RP API returns different error codes for different error cases. However, to prevent data mining the RPs must not show different UI messages for those cases and make enumeration attacks more difficult. In cases where the user does not have an account, HTTP status code 404 is returned by the RP API. This could be caused by the user entering wrong ID code. It is recommended that RPs verify the user ID code checksums when possible to catch these errors. Whenever an RP session creation request (POST to signature/certificate-choice/ or signature/) is repeated inside a 15-second timeframe with exactly the same parameters, session ID of an existing session can be returned as a result. This allows to retry RP POST requests in case of communication errors. When the caller wants, it can override the idempotent behaviour inside this timeframe using an optional nonce parameter present for signature/certificate-choice and signature POST requests. Normally, that parameter can be omitted. IMPORTANT Providing nonce parameter is not allowed for authentication requests, since each authentication request must provide a randomly generated value for rpChallenge, making each authentication request already unique. RP API clients are authenticated based on their originating IP-address and relyingPartyUUID protocol parameter combinations. When authentication fails, server responds with HTTP error 401. relyingPartyName request field is case-insensitive and must match one of the names configured for the calling RP. The names are UTF-8 encoded and are displayed to the user in the Smart-ID application. The Smart-ID service reserves the right to add new fields into responses of the current RP API version. Therefore, the RP must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response objects at any location within the JSON structure. It is essential that RP client performs all the required checks when connecting to the Smart-ID RP API HTTPS endpoint, to make sure that the connection endpoint is authentic and that the connection is secure. This is required to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for the authentication and signature protocols. The RP must perform the following checks: Verify the HTTPS connection and the TLS handshake is performed with a secure TLS cipher suite. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint belongs to the well-known public key of the Smart-ID API. The RP must implement HTTPS key (or certificate) pinning. Verify the X.509 certificate of the HTTPS endpoint is valid (not expired, signed by trusted CA and not revoked). In case the RP fails to verify the connection is genuine and secure an attacker might be able to launch a MITM attack on the connection and either login as the user or have the user sign a forged document.","title":"API technical description","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"api_details","url":"/rp-api/api_details.html","titles":[{"text":"HTTP status codes","hash":"_http_status_codes","id":1},{"text":"Error responses","hash":"_error_responses","id":2},{"text":"Idempotent behaviour","hash":"_idempotent_behaviour","id":3},{"text":"Interface authentication","hash":"_interface_authentication","id":4},{"text":"API client must ignore unknown names (fields) in JSON response object","hash":"_api_client_must_ignore_unknown_names_fields_in_json_response_object","id":5},{"text":"RP API endpoint authentication","hash":"_rp_api_endpoint_authentication","id":6}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"OpenAPI specification :: Smart-ID documentation Smart-ID documentation Back to docs Smart-ID Documentation Getting started Try out Smart-ID integration Environments Device link fallback page HTTPS pinning Client libraries Suggestions Logos FAQ App Release Notes Contact Automated testing Introduction Device link test endpoint Test accounts Relying Party API Introduction Changes Glossary Overview of API endpoints OpenAPI specification Device link flows authCode calculation Notification based flows API technical description Interactions Signature protocols Callback URLs Response verification Additional security measures Relying Party API 3.1.7 Documentation Relying Party API 3.1.7 3.1.6 3.1.5 3.1.4 3.1.3 3.0.3 Scalar.createApiReference('#app', { url: '../_/static/RP-API_V3.yml', showSidebar: true, hideModels: true, withDefaultFonts: false, darkMode: false, hideDarkModeToggle: true, forceDarkModeState: 'light', hideDarkModeToggle: true, hideClientButton: true, customCss: ` #app { --scalar-color-1: var(--caption-font-color);

Used as the key in authCode calculation. Must be Base64 decoded before use. schemeName Scheme name is defined by Smart-ID service and it ties the link to the Smart-ID context. The schemeName value depends on the environment. See Environments page for concrete values. signatureProtocol Allowed values: ACSP_V2 - for authentication session, RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE - for signature session, empty - for certificate-choice session. rpChallenge rpChallenge used in the initial authentication request. For more details, see ACSP_V2 signature request parameters. digest digest used in the initial signature request. For more details, see RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters. relyingPartyName relyingPartyName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. brokeredRpName brokeredRpName used in the initial authentication or signature requests in Base64 encoded form. This is only used by those RPs that act as a broker for other RPs. Otherwise must be empty. interactions interactions used in the initial authentication or signature request in Base64 encoded form. Empty for certificate-choice session request. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be reused here in order to guarantee that the values match exactly. initialCallbackUrl Callback URL the Smart-ID app will add parameters to and launch after a successful signature has been given (only in Web2App and App2App flows). Must use HTTPS scheme and there must not be URL fragments (#) in the URL. Must be different URLs in App2App and Web2App flows. unprotectedDeviceLink The final URL without the authCode field. Including this in authCode calculation ensures that the link itself can’t be changed by any malicious party. RP API returns sessionSecret in Base64 encoded form.

IMPORTANT If Web2App and App2App flows are used by the same RP, the initialCallbackUrl base (without the random parameter) must be different for both flows, otherwise Web2App flow callbackUrl might wrongly end up in the RP app. For Web2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP website. RP website backend has to set a session cookie to the user’s browser. This cookie must be set as SameSite=Lax because later, the Smart-ID app will launch the callback URL using top-level navigation and the request type will be GET. RP website backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP website backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL address of RP website and their browser will have the same session cookie. Some aspects to take into account are: User will end up on a new browser tab; The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP website sends the callback URL to RP website backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP website backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session cookie matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; Verify that the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret equals to sessionSecretDigest in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the user session cookie that was generated previously and invalidate the used callbackUrl. The previous session cookie or the used callbackUrl must not be accepted after they are used once. Failing to invalidate the callbackUrl after use may leave the user vulnerable to a phishing attack. Redirect the user to a new page and show authenticated session. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. In cases where user initiated the authentication/signing flow on a mobile browser that was not their default browser, the HTTPS callback URL will probably be opened in the default browser which will not have the session cookie and thus the verification must fail. The protocol steps for handling App2App callback URLs are functionally the same as for Web2App; however, there are also some differences in the steps below due to fundamental differences between webpages and apps. For App2App callback URLs, the following steps must be followed: The user initiates authentication or signing flow on RP app. RP app has to save a session identifier in the app’s storage. RP app backend makes a request to RP API and in the initialCallbackUrl, attaches a random parameter as a query parameter which it also saves in the backend and associates it with the session. The objective is for every initialCallbackUrl in any session to be unique and unpredictable. RP app backend saves the BASE64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of sessionSecret as sessionSecretDigest for later use during verification of the callbackUrl. Once the user has signed (or rejected the transaction), they are redirected to the callback URL, which will cause RP app to open (for this to work, RP app has to be configured to handle that domain and path of the URL). The callback URL contains an additional parameter sessionSecretDigest which is the Base64URL encoded SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret; and in case of authentication flows, it also contains the parameter userChallengeVerifier which is also Base64URL encoded. RP app sends the callback URL together with the session identifier from storage to RP app backend. RP website backend polls RP API /v3/session/{sessionID} endpoint for the session API response. Note that this can be done before or after the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL. RP app backend performs the following checks: Verify that the user’s session identifier matches with the random parameter attached in the callback URL; Verify that the SHA-256 digest of the sessionSecret equals to sessionSecretDigest in the callback URL; In authentication flows, verify that after applying the SHA-256 hash algorithm to userChallengeVerifier value (as is, without Base64URL decoding), the result equals to the userChallenge within the signature object sent by the RP API in the session API response; Perform the response verification steps described in Response verification page. Note that this cannot be performed before the user has returned to the RP website via the callback URL; Invalidate the old user session and generate a new one. callbackUrl must be invalidated after use and must not be accepted after it is used once. Failing to invalidate the callbackUrl after use may leave the user vulnerable to a phishing attack. IMPORTANT If any of these steps fail to verify, deny the authentication or signature attempt. Linked notification based flows are used in cases where the certificate of the user is required before the digest to be signed can be generated. In these flows callbackUrl is required and it is supplied by the RP in the initial device link based certificate choice request. However, the callbackUrl is not immediately used after the certificate choice request, and is only used after the /v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint is called with the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter and the flow is completed. If the initial callback URL provided by RP backend is: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ then in the authentication flow the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc&userChallengeVerifier=XtPfaGa8JnGtYrJjboooUf0KfY9sMEHrWFpSQrsUv9c In the signature and certificate-choice flows the full callback URL would be: https://rp.example.com/callback-url?value=RrKjjT4aggzu27YBddX1bQ&sessionSecretDigest=U4CKK13H1XFiyBofev9asqrzIrY5_Gszi_nL_zDKkBc For both Web2App and App2App callback URLs, the checks described above provide complete phishing resistance. Always prefer device link flows if possible.

Added device link based interaction flows (QR code, Web2App, App2App) for authentication, signing, and certificate-choice. Added distinct API endpoints for device link and notification based flows. Example: /v3/authentication/device-link/…​ vs. /v3/authentication/notification/…​ App2App and Web2App device link flows include a mandatory initialCallbackUrl parameter. It is used to construct the final callback URL to which the end-user is redirected after a successful PIN entry. Added new signature protocols: ACSP_V2 (Authentication Context Signing Protocol) RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE (signing pre-computed digests) Added capability to link a device link based certificate-choice request to a subsequent notification based signature request via /v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number}. Added an endpoint /v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} to request signing certificates when document number is know. This means that certificate-choice should only be used now before signature sessions in cases where document number is not know (e.g., no prior Smart-ID authentication). To prevent replay attacks, the mandatory rpChallenge parameter (an RP-generated random value) has been introduced for all initial v3 requests, effectively replacing the nonce parameter used in v2. The RSASSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 signature padding scheme has been removed and is replaced by RSASSA-PSS, which is now the only supported option for RSA signatures. This change includes support for SHA-3 hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512) with RSASSA-PSS. Revised Verification Code (VC) generation for notification flows: Authentication flows: VC is derived from rpChallenge. Signing flows: VC is randomly generated by the Smart-ID RP API server. Introduced a possibility for new verification code formats in the future. For now, the existing format (four numbers) will still be the only option. App2App and Web2App device link flows now require callback verification process as part of the response verification process. The certificatechoice (v2) functionality is now certificate-choice (v3). It has been moved to /v3/signature/certificate-choice/…​. It now also supports device link based flows. The allowedInteractionsOrder parameter has been renamed to interactions, and its value (a JSON array of objects) must now be Base64 encoded. The standalone interaction type verificationCodeChoice has been removed. Use confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice instead for flows that require a verification code choice. The RP API server now provides the device link base URL to RPs. The session status response (GET /session/{sessionID}) now includes userChallenge and flowType. Added interactionTypeUsed to v3 responses. Added new session result.endResult status codes: USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION PROTOCOL_FAILURE SERVER_ERROR USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION replaced previous result.endResult status codes (the used interaction type is now provided separately): USER_REFUSED_DISPLAYTEXTANDPIN USER_REFUSED_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE_WITH_VC_CHOICE Uses v2 instead of v1 in URL, {rp-api-baseurl}/v2/ instead of {rp-api-baseurl}/v1/. Introduced allowedInteractionsOrder parameter to authentication and signing requests which replaces displayText and requestProperties.vcChoice parameters. Added interactionTypeUsed parameter to the session status response message. Added new session result.endResult status codes: REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP USER_REFUSED_DISPLAYTEXTANDPIN USER_REFUSED_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE_WITH_VC_CHOICE USER_REFUSED_CERT_CHOICE Added requestProperties parameter for /v2/certificatechoice endpoint. New option shareMdClientIpAddress for parameter requestProperties Removed previously deprecated object reference pno/:country/:national-identity-number. Use etsi/:id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural instead. RPs must ignore any unknown names (fields) in the JSON response object.","title":"Changes","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"changes","url":"/rp-api/changes.html","titles":[{"text":"RP API version 3 changes compared to version 2","hash":"_rp_api_version_3_changes_compared_to_version_2","id":1},{"text":"New features","hash":"_new_features","id":2},{"text":"Security enhancements","hash":"_security_enhancements","id":3},{"text":"API endpoint and parameter changes","hash":"_api_endpoint_and_parameter_changes","id":4},{"text":"RP API version 2 changes compared to version 1","hash":"_rp_api_version_2_changes_compared_to_version_1","id":5}]},"82":{"id":82,"text":"The device link flows are the primary flows to be used for initiating Smart-ID transactions. It consists of the following steps: User interacts with an RP frontend (a webpage or an app). RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a device link based session (authentication, signature, or certificate-choice) to obtain security parameters that are necessary for generating device links. For authentication and certificate-choice sessions, the request may either be anonymous (no personal identifier is provided) or non-anonymous (signature session can’t be anonymous). RP starts creating device links. In case of QR codes, but not Web2App nor App2App links, the links must be updated each second. The device links must be generated in the RP backend and then forwarded to the RP frontend each time. RP frontend displays QR codes / Web2App links / App2App links. The user interacts with one of them by either: Opening Smart-ID app and scanning the dynamic QR code (preferred option for QR codes); Using a native camera app to scan the dynamic QR code (not supported by all camera apps) which opens the Smart-ID app where user has to scan the QR code again. Clicking on the Web2App link in an RP webpage, thus opening the Smart-ID app; Clicking on the App2App link in an RP app, thus opening the Smart-ID app. Smart-ID app extracts the necessary parameters and makes a request to the Smart-ID backend to check the integrity, validity and freshness of the device link. If the request was non-anonymous, it is verified that the provided personal identifier agrees with the actual user’s identity. The user is asked to verify the transaction details and enter their PIN. After the signature has been given, the RP receives the result via the session status endpoint. In case of anonymous flow, RP learns the identity of the user only at this point (via the user’s certificate). User is redirected back to the RP with the given callback URL in same-device flows and RP performs the callback URL verification steps described in Callback URLs page. IMPORTANT For device link flows, a single request must be sent. For a single session that displays both a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, multiple requests must not be sent. Some examples: If an RP would like to display a Web2App or App2App link without a dynamic QR code, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started. If an RP would like to display a dynamic QR code without the option for Web2App or App2App links, a device link flow can be started without a callback URL. If an RP would like to display both, a dynamic QR code and a Web2App or App2App link, a device link flow with a callback URL must be started (but the callback URL will only be relevant if the user interacts with the Web2App/App2App link, not the QR code). In same-device flow, it may be easier for RP to send a request to session status endpoint only after the callback has been received. This is only relevant when the QR code flow is not provided. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the authentication session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the signature session. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the certificateChoice session. When RP backend makes a request to RP API to create a new device link based session, RP API server generates and returns the following parameters as a response: sessionID - session ID (RP UUID); sessionToken - unique value that is used to connect this authentication/signing attempt between the relevant parties (RP, RP API, Smart-ID app); sessionSecret - Base64 encoded key value that must be kept secret and must not be shared with any other party (including RP frontend); deviceLinkBase - the base URL to be used to generate the QR/Web2App/App2App device links. RP then calculates the Web2App or App2App device link and dynamic QR code and shows it to the end user. The dynamic QR code must be updated regularly with the interval of 1 second. It is recommended that RP offers multiple options, QR image and Web2App link, to the user at the same time if either: RP is unable to detect from the user agent whether the user is using a mobile device or a PC, The user is accessing RP website from a mobile device, for example a tablet device, and might want to authenticate using a separate mobile device. NOTE The device link structure is similar for both same-device and cross-device flows. The differences between them are: The value of deviceLinkType is different (Web2App, App2App vs QR), same-device links do not have elapsedSeconds and should not be dynamically regenerated, the final representation of the link to the user is different (a clickable HTTPS link vs a dynamic QR code). IMPORTANT All values in the deviceLink are case-sensitive. The resulting deviceLink must match bit by bit with the expected deviceLink in the Smart-ID backend. There must not be URL encoding in the deviceLink. There must not be URL fragment (#) in the deviceLink. The order of the path parameters in the device link must be the same as specified in the examples below. All values are required and must be non-empty; the only exceptions to this are: in certificate-choice session requests parameters digest, interactions and signatureProtocol must be included as empty fields; in QR flows, initialCallbackUrl must be included as an empty field; in same-device flows, elapsedSeconds parameter must be missing from unprotectedDeviceLink.

QR code (authentication session) For more details on how the dynamic QR code or other device links should be presented in the RP frontend, see Device link and QR presentation section. The table below explains the parameters that are included in the device link calculation. Parameter Formula version A pre-defined version value, currently 1.0. sessionToken Generated by RP API. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is. deviceLinkType Allowed values: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. sessionType Allowed values: auth - for authentication session, sign - signature session, cert - certificate-choice session. elapsedSeconds Seconds since receiving the response from the initial request to RP API. Only used in cross-device flows (dynamic QR code). lang An ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It should match the language that the user was seeing in the RP UI previously. This only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. authCode Calculated using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, using sessionSecret as the key, authCodePayload as the payload, and represented in Base64URL encoding. Explained in a separate page. IMPORTANT The calculation of device links must be performed in the RP backend. All values (including elapsedSeconds) must all be generated in the RP backend and the RP frontend must not be able to change or affect these parameters. For dynamic QR code flows, the dynamic generation (every 1s) of the authCode parameter must be done in the RP backend, NOT in the RP frontend or RP app so as not to leak the sessionSecret parameter. Also, it is forbidden to generate values of authCode parameter ahead of time and forward them to the RP frontend/app. version parameter is a pre-defined value. Currently, only 1.0 is supported. It must be used in string form in device links. Example 6. version parameter \"1.0\" RP API returns sessionToken. It is a URL safe value and it must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 7. sessionToken parameter \"wGIrqveE6AuGDATZKmR1mtAZ\" The parameter deviceLinkType describes the device link type: QR - for dynamic QR codes, Web2App - for non-dynamic Web2App device links, App2App - for non-dynamic App2App device links. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 8. deviceLinkType parameter \"QR\" The parameter sessionType describes the session type: auth - for authentication session, sign - for signature session, cert - for certificate-choice session. The string value must be used as is (in string form) in device links. Example 9. sessionType parameter \"auth\" The elapsedSeconds parameters is seconds since receiving the response from the initial session creation request to RP API. Notice that dynamic QR code link must be re-calculated each second because the elapsedSeconds value changes. elapsedSeconds value must be converted to string value to be used in QR code links: elapsedSeconds := TO-STRING(elapsedSeconds) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby public class Int2Str { public static void main(String[] args) { int elapsedSeconds = 22; String elapsedSecondsStr = Integer.toString(elapsedSeconds); System.out.println(elapsedSecondsStr); } } <?php $elapsedSeconds = 22; $elapsedSecondsStr = strval($elapsedSeconds); echo $elapsedSecondsStr; ?> elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = str(elapsed_seconds) print(elapsed_seconds_str) package main import ( \"fmt\" \"strconv\" ) func main() { var elapsedSeconds int = 22 var elapsedSecondsStr string = strconv.Itoa(elapsedSeconds) fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", elapsedSecondsStr) } fn main() { let elapsed_seconds: i32 = 22; let elapsed_seconds_str: String = elapsed_seconds.to_string(); println!(\"{}\", elapsed_seconds_str) } fun main() { val elapsedSeconds: Int = 22 val elapsedSecondsStr: String = elapsedSeconds.toString() println(elapsedSecondsStr) } using System; public class Int2Str { public static void Main() { int elapsedSeconds = 22; string elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.ToString(); Console.WriteLine(elapsedSecondsStr); } } let elapsedSeconds = 22; let elapsedSecondsStr = elapsedSeconds.toString(); console.log(elapsedSecondsStr); elapsed_seconds = 22 elapsed_seconds_str = elapsed_seconds.to_s puts elapsed_seconds_str Example 10. elapsedSeconds parameter \"22\" The lang parameter defines the interface language for the HTTPS fallback page that is shown to the user when there are technical problems regarding opening device links (for example, if user’s browser does not support Web2App links and needs to be configured to allow them or if Smart-ID app is not installed on the phone). Its format must be ISO 639-2 three-letter language code. It is recommended that for consistent user experience, RP provides here the same language that the user was already using in the RP UI. This parameter only affects the language of the fallback page, not the Smart-ID app itself. Example 11. lang parameter \"eng\" authCode parameter generation is explained in detail in authCode calculation page. The following table aims to clarify which of the parameters involved in device link construction should be accessible by which parties (see legend below). The table also includes parameters which are used for authCode calculation (e.g. unprotectedDeviceLink)--for their descriptions, see authCode calculation page. RP API server RP backend RP frontend/app version sessionID sessionToken sessionSecret deviceLinkType sessionType signatureProtocol rpChallenge digest relyingPartyName brokeredRpName interactions initialCallbackUrl unprotectedDeviceLink elapsedSeconds authCode lang Legend: - source of parameter (the party that generates/calculates it) - knows parameter - does not know parameter - MUST NOT know parameter For cases when the app is not installed or some other problem occurs with opening a device link, a fallback HTTPS webpage is opened with instructions on how to resolve the issue. The lang parameter in the link is by default used to show the same language as on the RP UI. The instructions cover the following scenarios: User is not on a mobile device where Smart-ID app is installed and has been allowed by the RP to use a wrong type of device link (e.g. a same-device link on a PC). Smart-ID App is not installed on the current device. Mobile browser does not support universal links / Android App links. Mobile OS/browser settings disallow the link and user intervention is required. For generation of QR codes, error correction level LOW or MEDIUM should be used. HIGH cannot be used due to the typical device link length. The QR code should have sufficient margins to enable quick scanning by the Smart-ID app. The optimal block size for QR code is 6-10 pixels per block when displayed on a PC, since: Block sizes 5 pixels and less are too small for easy scanning (devices might have focus issues, although many will not). Block sizes 20 pixels and above are too big for convenient scanning and take up too much space. When QR code is displayed on a mobile device, it is recommended to show the QR code as big as possible, up to 10 pixels per block. QR code can be generated on the client or server. It is recommended to use the SVG format as it remains sharp when users zoom the page. Note that many QR code libraries that support SVG output do not accept block size as an input parameter. So, block size should be estimated based on overall image dimensions, device link length and error correction level. See QR generator section for an example which also calculates the resulting block size in pixels. IMPORTANT The actual generation of the QR image can be done both in the backend or the frontend, however the link itself must only be generated by the RP backend. This is because sensitive parameters such as sessionSecret must never be sent to the RP frontend. This form allows to test different QR code sizes with the recommended parameters and estimate the block size in pixels.

ACSP_V2 Version 2 of the ACSP protocol. App RP’s mobile application running on a user’s device. The app is used to interact with the RP’s e-service and in the background, the app is communicating to the RP’s backend or website. Authentication key pair (or authentication key) Key pair that is used to digitally authenticate a person. Certificate Authority (CA) An entity that issues certificates for Smart-ID account owners. Cross-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in a different device. These use cases are usually used with dynamic QR codes and notification flows. Key pair A Pair of keys that are required for digital signature scheme. There are two kinds of key pairs (or shortly, keys) in the Smart-ID system, authentication key pair and signature key pair. The word pair refers to the private and public keys of each key pair used in an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, here RSA. Mobile device A tablet computer or smartphone that runs a mobile device operating system (Apple iOS, Google Android). Person A natural person who uses the Smart-ID system to authenticate herself to an RP and to issue digital signatures requested by RP. Registration Authority (RA) An entity responsible for recording or verifying some or all of the information (particularly the identities of subjects) needed by a CA to issue certificates and CRLs and to perform other certificate management functions. Relying Party request A request from an RP that requires some kind of operation in the Smart-ID backend system. It may or may not create a transaction. Relying Party (RP) An organization or service, for example a bank, that uses the Smart-ID service to authenticate its users and to get them to sign the documents. Same-device use case Use cases that start from an RP in one device and continues with the Smart-ID app in the same device. Signature key pair (or signature key) Key pair that is used to give digital signatures of a person. Smart-ID account A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID system. Account binds a Smart-ID app instance (installed on a person’s mobile device) to a person’s identity in the Smart-ID system. In the course of account creation and registration, the identity of the account owner (person) is proofed by a Registration Authority (RA) and the relation between the identity and a key pair is certified by a Certificate Authority (CA). An account has a signature key pair and an authentication key pair. Smart-ID app A technical component of the Smart-ID system. A mobile app instance installed on a person’s mobile device that provides access to Smart-ID functionality for persons. Smart-ID provider An organization that is legally responsible for the Smart-ID system. Smart-ID server A technical component of the Smart-ID system. Server-side counterpart of the Smart-ID app. Handles backend operations and provides API-s to Relying Party (RP). Smart-ID system A technical and organizational environment that enables digital authentication and issuing of digital signatures of persons in an electronic environment. The Smart-ID system provides services that allow persons (Smart-ID account owners) to authenticate themselves to RPs, to give digital signatures requested by RPs, and to manage their Smart-ID accounts. Users Natural persons with registered Smart-ID accounts. Users authenticate to the RP’s e-service and create digital signatures with the browser or the RP’s app. Verification Code (VC) Verification codes are 4 numbers shown to the user for notification based (authentication and signature) flows to let the user bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. Website (e-service) Information system built by RP and uses Smart-ID service to authenticate users and to create digital signatures. The website is integrated with the Smart-ID RP API (this documentation).","title":"Glossary","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"glossary","url":"/rp-api/glossary.html","titles":[]},"85":{"id":85,"text":"Smart-ID app can support different interaction types and a Relying Party (RP) can demand a particular interaction with or without a fallback possibility. Different interactions can support different amount of data to display information to user. Each interaction is defined by an object that has 2 parameters: type and either displayText60 or displayText200. The following table shows interaction types available for each flow type. Linked notification based flow refers to the BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked endpoint. Interaction type & extra parameter Description Device link based flows Notification based flows Linked notification based flow displayTextAndPIN with displayText60 The simplest interaction with max 60 chars of text and PIN entry on a single screen. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessage with displayText200 First screen is for text only (max 200 chars) and has Confirm and Cancel buttons. Second screen is for PIN. Yes Yes Yes confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice with displayText200 First screen combines text and Verification Code choice. Second screen is for PIN. No Yes No All three interactions types are currently supported by all the clients. RP uses interactions parameter to list interactions it allows for the current session. New interaction types may be introduced in the future. However, it takes some time until all apps have been updated and are actually capable of displaying the new types. After introduction of a new interaction type both the new interaction type as a well as an older type should be provided in the array for clients that have not been yet updated. The interactions parameter is a Base64 encoded JSON array and the order of the items is significant. Each interaction in the array is a JSON object consisting of the type, and either displayText60 or displayText200. The first interaction that is supported by a specific app installation will be used. The interaction that was used is always reported back to RP with interactionTypeUsed response parameter to the session request. If an app cannot support any interaction requested then the session is cancelled with reason code REQUIRED_INTERACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_APP. IMPORTANT The following requirements apply for the interaction object: For each interaction, the type and the corresponding displayText (either displayText60 or displayText200) parameters are mandatory. Meaning that each interaction must include a non-empty displayText60 or displayText200 parameter. It is forbidden to provide both displayText60 and displayText200 parameters. It is not allowed to have more than one interaction with the same type value. In addition, it is not allowed to list interaction types not meant for the flow (device link flow or notification based flow). JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional). Therefore, the specific Base64-encoded string generated from the interactions object to initiate the session must be stored and reused in all subsequent calculations. This is relevant for all device link flows, more specifically in: authCode calculation; ACSP_V2 digest calculation (authentication only) during response verification. Failing to meet the first 4 requirements above will result in an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request). Failing to follow the last recommendation can result in some dynamic link sessions failing. If authCode calculation returns a different value from what RP API calculates, then the device link will be rejected due to wrong authCode value. If ACSP_V2 digest is calculated incorrectly, a valid user authentication signature will appear to be invalid and RP will have to deny the authentication attempt. displayText is a short text string displayed to the user in the Smart-ID authentication or digital signature consent screen. It helps the user understand the context of the operation. displayText will be displayed on the authentication or signing consent screen. The RP can use this to distinguish between the different information systems or different services within the RP, when requesting the authentication. When requesting a digital signature, the RP can use this to give information about the nature of signature, such as the name of the document to be signed or information about the transfer order to be executed. For example, in case the RP is using Smart-ID to authenticate users calling the RP’s helpdesk via phone, these authentication requests must use a different displayText than requests sent by the RP’s website. This way the user has greater confidence that the person on the phone (a helpdesk agent who might be out-sourced from an external company) is not logging into the website of the RP under the name of the user. displayText value can only be set by the RP backend and phishing attacks can’t change it. This is why, it is recommended to use the displayText to alert users and show warnings if an attack is suspected. For more details, see Additional security measures page. The displayText60 and displayText200 parameters are used by the Smart-ID app to display text on the screen. The preferred way of writing displayText60 and displayText200 is to explain the action user is taking which the user is expected to confirm. The descriptions should be concise and specific allowing the user to verify the context of the operation quickly. A few examples: Logging in to internet banking Log in to mobile banking app Applying for a credit card application, 1000€ credit limit Signing document Contract.asice Transfer 1000€ to Jane Doe GB33BUKB20201555555555 Usually, the Relying Party name does not need to be part of the display text as the RP name parameter is always displayed to the user along with the display text. Before sending the RP API request, interactions array must be turned into a string and then Base64 encoded. The interactions JSON should be minified to lower the overhead.

The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use cases: authentication and digital signing. Smart-ID is a secure digital identity service that enables users to authenticate and create digital signatures using their mobile device. The service works through a collaboration between: Relying Parties (RPs) - organizations that need to verify user identity or obtain digital signatures Smart-ID service - the backend infrastructure that manages authentication and signing processes Smart-ID mobile app - the user’s interface for confirming transactions The typical Smart-ID workflow follows these steps: A user wants to authenticate or sign a document with a Relying Party The RP creates a session by calling the Smart-ID RP API with either: A challenge (for authentication) A document hash (for digital signing) The user interacts with Smart-ID through one of these methods: Scanning a dynamic QR code (cross-device) Clicking a link (same-device) Receiving a push notification The user verifies transaction details and confirms the transaction in the Smart-ID app The Smart-ID service generates the digital signature The RP receives the result and validates the user’s certificate The latest version introduces device link flows--a unified approach for cross-device and same-device scenarios. Device link flows provide a modern and more secure alternative to push notification flows. Device link—​a unified approach for cross-device and same-device scenarios Users scan dynamic QR codes when the RP session is on a different device than their Smart-ID app (e.g., using a PC browser to access an RP website). Cross-device device link flow Users click device links when the RP frontend (website or app) is on the same mobile device as their Smart-ID app: Web2App - to navigate from RP website to Smart-ID app; App2App - to navigate from RP app to Smart-ID app. Same-device device link flow Unified Flow: All flows share the same API endpoints and security mechanisms despite different launch methods Flexible Integration: RPs can offer multiple authentication methods simultaneously Enhanced Security: Device link flows provide better protection than notification-based flows RP API v3 still has notification based flows that are very similar to previous versions of the RP API. Users enter their identity code. They then receive a notification on their device(s). Notification based flow When integrating RP API v3, every RP has to make a choice between using device links, notification-based flows, or a combination of them. Essentially, there are three possible options: Always use device links Use device links once on a new device, and use push notifications on known devices Always use push notifications This choice should be done after careful consideration to ensure that RP and its users obtain maximum possible security and user experience benefits. The following table gives an overview of the possible options and their implications. Flow on a new device Flow on a known device Protection against phishing attacks Recommendation QR code link QR code link Maximum protection against phishing attacks Recommended QR code link Push notification Enhanced protection against phishing attacks Recommended Push notification Push notification Phishing protection relies on user awareness Not recommended Table 1. Available options for implementing the cross-device flow. For same-device use cases, the same security considerations apply as for the cross-device use cases. However, there are even more benefits for always using device link flows in the same-device use case: they provide a seamless user experience, where user has to only make one click to open up the Smart-ID app; user does not have to verify verification codes (which can be highly problematic for users to verify in same-device flows); they provide highest phishing resistance possible, relying on the fact that RP frontend and Smart-ID app reside in the same device. Flow on a new device Flow on a known device Protection against phishing attacks Recommendation Web2App/App2App link Web2App/App2App link Maximum protection against phishing attacks Best user experience Recommended Web2App/App2App link Push notification Enhanced protection against phishing attacks Less smooth user experience Not recommended Push notification Push notification Phishing protection relies on user awareness Less smooth user experience Not recommended Table 2. Available options for implementing the same-device flow. Although Smart-ID service is a technology designed with security in mind, Relying Parties (RPs) need to consider potential risks which are associated with digital authentication and signing solutions. It is important that RPs implement additional security mechanisms to help users understand the context of their actions and protect them from possible attacks. Throughout this integration guide, we describe effective security measures for mitigating attacks, however not all security measures are considered mandatory for all RPs. Nevertheless, there’s nobody else who can implement those defences and security measures on their behalf. It is the RP’s opportunity and responsibility to carefully assess these risks and select appropriate countermeasures to prevent cybercriminals from being successful in their actions. Throughout this guide, the following types of information blocks are used: IMPORTANT Important blocks contain critical information that must be followed without exception. Ignoring them may lead to security issues or implementation failures. NOTE Note blocks provide additional information and clarify implementation details. TIP Tip blocks describe optional features and provide additional information that can be used to enhance your implementation. To understand the technical details of the solution, start by reading the Overview of API endpoints. For additional information about device link flows, continue to read the Device Link flows page.

It simulates the behavior of a mobile device running the Smart-ID application, allowing RPs to test their Smart-ID integrations without the need for an actual phone or real user interaction. Instead of waiting for a user to interact with their device, the Mock Service automatically produces predefined outcomes such as a successful transaction, a cancelled transaction, or a timeout. When the RP sends a request to the Smart-ID Demo environment, the Mock Service steps in to act as the “user” and completes the request with the result that corresponds to the document number provided in the request. All the steps that the RP does, such as creating the request, polling the results, and validating the returned signature, are exactly the same as they would be with actual mobile devices. From the RP’s point of view, the flow behaves as though a real end-user had taken part in the transaction. The Mock Service can be used in two main ways: through the notification flow and through the device link–based flow. In both cases, the RP follows the same sequence of actions as in Live environment, with the only difference being that the user’s mobile device is replaced by the Mock Service. The notification flow is the most straightforward, where the Smart-ID Core communicates directly with the mobile app. With device link–based flows introduced in RP API v3, the user is expected to interact with a device link that opens the Smart-ID app. Device links can appear in different forms: a QR code scanned by the user, a Web2App link clicked in a browser on the same device, or an App2App link opened from another mobile application. The Mock Service provides simulation for all of these cases, ensuring that RPs can test every supported scenario in the Demo environment. Each document number corresponds to a specific result type. For instance, one document number may consistently provide a successful authentication, while another may always produce an error or a timeout. When a RP submits a request to the RP API using one of these document numbers, the Service retrieves the number, identifies the associated outcome, and responds accordingly. In the Notification based flow, the Mock Service operates exactly like an actual mobile device. RP initiates a request, indicating one of the preconfigured document numbers, and the Service delivers the corresponding mapped result. Then, the RP polls for the transaction outcome and proceeds with validation as if the process had been executed on a real device. The following diagram describes the simplified version of the notification based flow for the signature session in Live environment (authentication session is omitted to avoid duplication). The full version of the diagram can be found at the Notification based flow page. The following diagram describes the notification based flow for the signature session via Mock Service. The Device link flow requires one additional step compared to the notification flow. Unlike the notification flow, where Core communicates directly with the mobile application, the device link flow requires the RP to generate and handle a special type of URL known as a device link. This link is then delivered to the user, who normally interacts with it on their device, which in turn opens the Smart-ID app. To achieve this flow in the Demo environment, the Mock Service requires the RP to simulate the user interaction. When the RP creates a device link request, it first receives three values from the RP API: sessionId, sessionToken, and sessionSecret. In the Live environment, these would be bound to the device link opened by the user. In the Demo environment, RP must send these values to the Mock Service through the device-link endpoint. This step simulates the user clicking or scanning the device link and guarantees that the Service can continue with the simulation of the outcome. After this link has been “used”, the Mock Service finalizes the transaction and generates the mapped result. In the Web2App and App2App flows, there is an additional step that occurs after the user has entered their PIN in Smart-ID app - the user is automatically re-directed to RP’s website or app. To replicate this in the Demo environment, the Mock Service processes the signing or authentication request and performs a GET request to the Callback URL supplied by the RP. It includes the appropriate cookies and additional parameters, such as the userChallengeVerifier and sessionSecretDigest, which the RP would normally receive via the callback URL from the real application. The following diagram describes the the simplified version of the device link based flow for the authentication session in Live environment. The full version of the diagram can be found at the Device link flow page. The following diagram describes the device link based flow for the authentication session via Mock Service.","title":"Mock Service","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"mock_service","url":"/rp-api/mock_service.html","titles":[{"text":"How to use","hash":"_how_to_use","id":1},{"text":"Notification flow","hash":"_notification_flow","id":2},{"text":"Device link flow","hash":"_device_link_flow","id":3},{"text":"Same-Device Flows (Web2App and App2App)","hash":"_same_device_flows_web2app_and_app2app","id":4}]},"88":{"id":88,"text":"Notification based flows are flows that rely on the push notification mechanism to notify the Smart-ID app. In these flows, the RP website or app shows a verification code (VC) which the user must compare to the VC displayed on Smart-ID to match the authentication or signature session. To force the user to perform the verification, the RP can request the Smart-ID app to display three VCs (one correct code and two random codes) and the user is required to select the correct code which is displayed by the RP website or app. In case the user doesn’t choose the correct code, the Smart-ID app aborts the request. This can be requested in the Smart-ID RP API call using the confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice interaction type. For details of the interactions object, see Interactions page. TIP In case of same-device use cases where the recommended App2App or Web2App device link flow cannot be used for some reason, then in notification flows it is recommended to include a small delay after showing the verification code to user and before starting the transaction on the RP API. This way, the user has additional time to look at the verification code on the RP’s app before the push notification arrives. Below, sequence diagrams are given along with explanations of the differences. The following diagram describes the notification based flow for the authentication session. The following sequence diagram illustrates the notification based signing flow. The following sequence diagram illustrates the device link based certificate choice flow being linked to a notification based signing flow. There are separate signing protocols for authentication and signature requests (see signature protocols for details). In RP API v3 notification based authentication requests, RP must compute verification codes (VC) for each authentication request, so the user can bind together the session on the browser or RP app and the authentication request on the Smart-ID app. The VC is computed as follows: Calculate SHA-256 from the rpChallenge, extract 2 rightmost bytes from the result, interpret them as a big-endian unsigned integer and take the last 4 digits in decimal form for display. SHA-256 must be used to calculate the VC.

Verification code 7180 In RP API v3 notification based signature requests, verification codes (VC) are not generated by RP based on the DTBS (data-to-be-signed), but are returned from the server to RP for security reasons. Verification codes are only relevant for the notification based flows. Currently, there is only one supported verification code type: numeric4 The returned verification code consists of 4 numbers. It must be shown to the user as it is received from the server.","title":"Notification based flows","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"notification_based_flows","url":"/rp-api/notification_based_flows.html","titles":[{"text":"Flow diagrams","hash":"_flow_diagrams","id":1},{"text":"Signature protocols","hash":"_signature_protocols","id":2},{"text":"Verification codes for authentication requests","hash":"verification_codes_for_authentication_requests","id":3},{"text":"Verification codes for signature requests","hash":"verification_codes_for_signature_requests","id":4}]},"89":{"id":89,"text":"The Relying Party API provides five different types of endpoints. The first four are POST requests that return a sessionID and the fifth is a GET request used to query for the result based on the sessionID. The POST v3/authentication/* session endpoints are used to log a user onto a system or otherwise verify the identity of a user; the POST v3/signature/* session endpoints are used to create digital signatures; the POST v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} endpoint is used to obtain the signing certificate of the requested document number; the POST v3/signature/certificate-choice/* session endpoints ([1], [2] and [3]) are used when the document number is not known immediately prior to the signature session and the user’s signing certificate is required to create the object that will be signed; finally, the GET v3/session/{sessionID} status endpoint provides the result of the above sessions. The implementation details are described on the OpenAPI specification page. There are two types of flows that can be used in v3/authentication/*, v3/signature/* and v3/signature/certificate-choice/* sessions - the device link based flow and the notification based flow. NOTE In order to improve security and prevent phishing attacks, it is recommended to only use device link based flows or only allow notification based flows on devices and browsers that have successfully completed a device link based flow beforehand. It is up to the RP to decide how to securely identify such devices/browsers and tie them to the user’s Smart-ID personal number by utilizing browser cookies, local app storage or other means. See additional security measures page for more details. There are different ways to reference users - via their issued identifier, a document number linking a specific account or even not at all (in case of anonymous device link based flows). The different object references are described on the OpenAPI specification page. IMPORTANT Once a user has been identified within an RP session, then in subsequent signing and certificate-choice requests the document-number reference should be used. The following diagram shows main authentication flows and which endpoints to use: The following diagram shows main signature flows and which endpoints to use: In order to authenticate a user, RPs must create a random challenge and use RP API to get user signature on it. Using the device link based flow is the most secure option and should be preferred. RP may call the anonymous device link based authentication session endpoint and display a dynamic QR code that the user must scan with the Smart-ID app or show a same-device (Web2App, App2App) link the user can interact with. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/anonymous Instead of using the anonymous authentication session endpoint, the RP may request the user to enter their user identifier and utilize the non-anonymous authentication session endpoint. This may be beneficial when the RP utilizes custom usernames and has the users' identifiers stored internally. The RP may simply always ask the user for the identifier as well. BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint should be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/device-link/document/{document-number} Notification based authentication session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. Using a notification based authentication session endpoint triggers a push notification to all the user’s devices instead of the user scanning the QR code or clicking the same-device link. BASE/v3/authentication/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} If there is a need to re-authenticate the user, the following endpoint can be used with the previously obtained document-number instead: BASE/v3/authentication/notification/document/{document-number} In order to obtain an electronic signature of a document (ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES or PDF with PAdES), RPs must create the document structure themselves, calculate the hash, and use RP API to get user signature on it. Signing can be done in two ways—​with or without prior Smart-ID authentication. Where applicable and reasonable, Signing with prior authentication should be preferred. However, there are valid use cases for Signing without prior authentication. If a user has already logged onto the RP app or website using Smart-ID authentication, the RP can call the certificate session endpoint to obtain the user’s signing certificate. As the document number is attained from the preceding authentication call, no user interaction is required for obtaining the certificate and the RP API can immediately provide it. BASE/v3/signature/certificate/{document-number} The RP can then call the device link based signature session endpoint to sign using the same Smart-ID account that was used for authentication. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/document/{document-number} The notification based signature session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} If no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, signing request may be done directly. For this, a signing certificate is still most likely required to be obtained first (this is true for all use cases known in practice, e.g. ASiC-E with XAdES/CAdES or PDF with PAdES). For obtaining the certificate and getting the user’s signature, the recommended way is to use the linked signing flow which is a new concept introduced in RP API v3. Linked signing flow consists of an anonymous device link based certificate-choice request followed by a notification based signing request. In case no prior Smart-ID authentication has taken place, and certificate is required, the anonymous device link based certificate-choice session endpoint should be used. BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/device-link/anonymous Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must call the notification based linked signature session endpoint and provide the mandatory linkedSessionID parameter (session ID of the previous certificate-choice session) to connect the signature and certificate-choice sessions. BASE/v3/signature/notification/linked/{document-number} The combination of device link based certificate-choice and notification based linked signature session endpoints provides the optimal user experience where Smart-ID app is launched only once and a verification code (VC) is not shown. If the certificate-choice session was completed using a same-device device link, then as the final step of the signing process, the Smart-ID app will launch the callbackUrl (which was provided in the device link based certificate-choice request that initiated the linked signing flow). The callbackUrl the user will end up will also have additional parameters as explained in Callback URLs page. NOTE In the flow described above, it is recommended to stop showing the QR code, Web2App or App2App link in the RP UI after the certificate is obtained. Notification based certificate-choice session endpoint can also be used for the same purpose but is not recommended. In this case, first use notification based certificate-choice session endpoint: BASE/v3/signature/certificate-choice/notification/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} Immediately after receiving the response with the certificate, RP must display the VC and call notification based signature session endpoint. BASE/v3/signature/notification/document/{document-number} IMPORTANT Notification based certificate-choice cannot be connected to notification based linked signature session endpoint with linkedSessionID. If notification based certificate-choice is used, verification code (VC) must still be shown to the user, and in same-device use cases, there might be usability issues with VC being shown too fast or not being shown at all (this is especially problematic for interactions involving confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice). If the certificate is not required, the device link based signature session endpoint should be called instead. Essentially this means that it is acceptable that the end user gives the signature using any of the Smart-ID devices in their possession. BASE/v3/signature/device-link/etsi/{id-etsi-qcs-SemanticsId-Natural} NOTE There is no anonymous device link based signature session endpoint, since in all practical signing use cases the user’s identity is known beforehand.","title":"Overview of API endpoints","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"overview_of_api_endpoints","url":"/rp-api/overview_of_api_endpoints.html","titles":[{"text":"Choosing which endpoints to use","hash":"_choosing_which_endpoints_to_use","id":1},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":2},{"text":"Device link based authentication","hash":"_device_link_based_authentication","id":3},{"text":"Notification based authentication","hash":"_notification_based_authentication","id":4},{"text":"Signing","hash":"_signing","id":5},{"text":"Signing with prior authentication","hash":"signing_with_prior_authentication","id":6},{"text":"Device link based signing with prior authentication","hash":"_device_link_based_signing_with_prior_authentication","id":7},{"text":"Notification based signing with prior authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_with_prior_authentication","id":8},{"text":"Signing without prior authentication","hash":"signing_without_prior_authentication","id":9},{"text":"Linked signing (without prior authentication)","hash":"_linked_signing_without_prior_authentication","id":10},{"text":"Notification based signing without prior authentication","hash":"_notification_based_signing_without_prior_authentication","id":11},{"text":"Device link based signing without prior authentication and without certificate","hash":"_device_link_based_signing_without_prior_authentication_and_without_certificate","id":12}]},"90":{"id":90,"text":"After receiving the transaction response from the session status API call the following algorithm must be used to decide if the authentication result is trustworthy and what the identity of the authenticating end user is, if the signature result is valid. In App2App and Web2App flows, the response verification step must be performed after the user has returned via the callback URL, as described in Callback URLs page. The following steps perform the response verification algorithm. Note that the algorithm is applicable to both authentication and signature session flows. Specific differences, such as the conditional execution of Steps 1 and 3, are noted within the steps. Session secret verification (applicable only for sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Base64 decode the sessionSecret string received in the initial request. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the Base64 decoded sessionSecret value. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Obtain the sessionSecretDigest value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the sessionSecretDigest obtained from the callback URL. Initial session response check: Verify the state field in the JSON response is exactly COMPLETE. Verify the result.endResult field is exactly OK. Verify the signatureProtocol field is exactly ACSP_V2 in case of authentication or RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE in case of signature. Ensure the cert, signature, and result objects are present and not null. User challenge verification (applicable only for authentication sessions with flow type Web2App or App2App): Obtain the userChallengeVerifier value from the callback URL parameter visited by the user upon returning to the RP website or application. Calculate the SHA-256 digest of the received userChallengeVerifier string. Encode the raw bytes of the calculated hash using Base64URL. Verify that this Base64URL encoded hash result exactly matches the signature.userChallenge string provided in the JSON response’s signature object. Certificate Chain Validation and Trust: Decode the Base64 encoded end-entity certificate string from cert.value and parse it into a standard X.509 certificate representation. The RP API provides only the end-entity certificate, the Relying Party must have the necessary root and intermediate CA certificates configured locally to allow the library to build the full certificate chain. For these certificates, see Certificates page. Using a standard cryptographic library, initiate the validation of the certificate chain starting from the end-entity certificate. Provide the end-entity certificate to the library, along with configuring it with the set of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors). It’s important to note that some libraries use the system certificate store in addition to the provided CA certificates, this should be disabled and only the explicitly configured CA certificates should be used. For each certificate in the constructed chain (end-entity certificate and all intermediate CA certificates), perform the following checks. A standard cryptographic library will typically perform the following checks as part of its overall chain validation routine and report the result as a success or failure. Verify the certificate’s digital signature using the public key of its issuer certificate. Verify the certificate’s validity period against the current time, i.e., not before the notBefore date and not after the notAfter date. Verify that the certificate has not been revoked. This check should be performed using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), utilizing the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension within the certificate to locate the OCSP responder URL. If OCSP fails or is unavailable, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking should be used as fallback. Note: Revocation checks (OCSP/CRL) are not performed on self-signed root CA certificates configured as trust anchors. Intermediate CA certificates can be revoked and must be checked. Note: OCSP responses are digitally signed. The certificate chain of the OCSP responder itself should also be verified, ensuring it is trusted and authorized to provide status for the certificate being checked. Verify basic constraints are appropriate: Intermediate CA certificates must have the Basic Constraints extension present with the cA boolean set to TRUE. For end-entity certificates, the Basic Constraints extension should either absent, or if present, its cA boolean should be set to FALSE. Smart-ID Scheme Identification (End-Entity Certificate): Before checking specific purposes, verify that the end-entity certificate belongs to the Smart-ID scheme. Examine the Certificate Policies extension of the end-entity certificate. The certificate must contain all the specific policy OIDs designated by SK ID Solutions for the Smart-ID scheme (as defined in Chapter 2.2.3 of the \"Certificate and OCSP Profile for Smart-ID\" in Certificate Profiles page). These OIDs differentiate Smart-ID certificates from other types of certificates (e.g., Mobile-ID, Estonian ID-card). The Relying Party must consult the current official SK ID Solutions Certificate Policies for the definitive list of Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs. For these certificate policies, see Certificate Policies page. If not all the recognized Smart-ID scheme policy OIDs are present, the certificate should not be processed as a Smart-ID certificate, and the verification should fail for this context. End-Entity Certificate Purpose Validation (Smart-ID Context): Examine the end-entity certificate for extensions and attributes required by the certificate profile. For these certificate profiles, see Certificate Profiles page. For Smart-ID authentication: To confirm the certificate is suitable for authentication, it must contain one of the following: The digitalSignature key usage and the Smart-ID authentication (1.3.6.1.4.1.62306.5.7.0) Extended Key Usage which is present in certificates issued April 2025 onwards. The digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment key usages and the id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) Extended Key Usage which is found in older, still valid certificates issued before April 2025. For digital signing: Check for appropriate key usage nonRepudiation. Assurance Level Check: Extract the assurance level string from cert.certificateLevel (e.g., ADVANCED, QUALIFIED). For qualified certificates, check that the extension values as defined by the certificate profile exist within the certificate from cert.value. Compare this level against the minimum assurance level required by the RP for the specific context or transaction. Ensure the certificate’s level meets or exceeds the required level (note that ADVANCED < QUALIFIED). Identity Match Check: Extract the authenticated user’s identifier from the end-entity certificate. For Smart-ID certificates serialNumber (OID 2.5.4.5) under Subject DN contain the national identity code, for example PNOEE-30001010004. If the RP initiated the authentication or signing for a specific known user, verify that the extracted identifier matches the expected identity for that session. Verification of signature Object (authentication/signature session): Only for authentication session: Reconstruct the exact ACSP_V2_payload string that was signed, as described under ACSP_V2 digest calculation. This is done by concatenating the fields in order, separated by the vertical bar character | (U+007C): 'smart-id'|'ACSP_V2'|serverRandom|rpChallenge|userChallenge|BASE64(relyingPartyName)|BASE64(brokeredRpName)|BASE64(SHA-256(interactions))|interactionTypeUsed|initialCallbackUrl|flowType Only for signature session: Use the data-to-be-signed, a digest of which was initially sent when initiating the signature session (as described in RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol). Decode the signature value from signature.value using Base64 decoding. Obtain the public key from the parsed end-entity user certificate (from Step 4). Only for authentication session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against the UTF-8 bytes of the reconstructed ACSP_V2_payload string. Only for signature session: Using a cryptographic library, verify the decoded signature against either the data-to-be-signed or the hash of the data-to-be-signed (there are libraries that provide options for either). Ensure the verification uses the algorithm specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm (e.g., rsassa-pss) and correctly applies the parameters from signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters (e.g., hash algorithm like SHA-512, MGF1 hash like SHA-512, salt length like 64, and the trailer field 0xbc). Session Management (Only for authentication sessions. Important: only perform if all the preceding steps (1-9) were successful): Invalidate any previous, unauthenticated session identifier associated with the user’s interaction (e.g., browser cookie or API token used before successful authentication). Generate a new, secure, and unique session identifier representing the now authenticated state. Associate the authenticated user’s identity (from Step 8) and potentially the assurance level (from Step 7) with this new session identifier in your server-side session store. After a successful action, the users should be able to view their actions or download the signed document.

Authentication Context Signature Protocol (ACSP) is a protocol that is used for authentication requests.

The digest is calculated over the ACSP_V2_payload, and ACSP_V2_payload is assembled using vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator. Rules of generating the digest value: in case initialCallbackUrl does not exist (for QR and Notification flows), this field must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; in case the RP is not acting as a broker, the brokeredRpName must be empty and the separator must still be used, i.e. ||; interactions must be the same Base64-encoded byte string value that was used to initiate the session. Since JSON to Base64 encoding is non-deterministic (parameters may be ordered randomly, whitespace can be optional), trying to encode the same object again might return a different value; the digest must be calculated from UTF-8 encoded byte array that consists of the described elements joined in the specified order with vertical bar character | (U+007C) as a separator, this also applies to Base64 encoded values, they must be used as is without Base64 decoding; Base64 encoding must also make sure that the unused bits are set to 0 and that the resulting values are correctly padded with = signs; the hash algorithm to use is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithmParameters.hashAlgorithm. The signature scheme that was used to generate the signature based on the digest is specified in signature.signatureAlgorithm. message := STR-CONCAT( 'smart-id', '|', 'ACSP_V2', '|', serverRandom, '|', rpChallenge, '|', userChallenge, '|', BASE64-ENCODE(relyingPartyName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(brokeredRpName), '|', BASE64-ENCODE(SHA-256(interactions)), '|', interactionTypeUsed, '|', initialCallbackUrl, '|', flowType) digest := HASH(UTF8-ENCODE(message)) Java PHP Python Go Rust Kotlin C# Node.js Ruby import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE is a signature protocol where a pre-calculated digest (hash) of the data-to-be-signed is sent in the initial request, and the digital signature is generated directly on this provided digest. For verification, the digest itself or the complete original data that corresponds to the digest must be used. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signatureProtocol and signatureProtocolParameters parameters in the signature requests and examples, see the API spec signature request parameters. The digest value sent with the initial RP request is the digest value of the data-to-be-signed. One of the supported hash algorithms must be used. The signature is directly generated on the digest value and the verification must be done using the data-to-be-signed. For RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature parameter in the signature response and examples, see the API spec session status response parameters. Full verification of the signature and response is described in Response verification. NOTE When integrating with Smart-ID RP API for electronic signing, note that RP API v3 and above only supports RSASSA-PSS signature scheme. Previous versions supported only the legacy RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme. Some national signature container formats do not support RSASSA-PSS and if alternatives are not available (such as the ASiC format that is internationally recognized), previous RP API versions might have to be used to obtain RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signatures.","title":"Signature protocols","component":"rp-api","version":"3.1.7","name":"signature_protocols","url":"/rp-api/signature_protocols.html","titles":[{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature protocol","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_protocol","id":1},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature request parameters","hash":"acsp_v2_signature_request_parameters","id":2},{"text":"rpChallenge generation","hash":"_rpchallenge_generation","id":3},{"text":"ACSP_V2 signature response parameters","hash":"_acsp_v2_signature_response_parameters","id":4},{"text":"ACSP_V2 digest calculation","hash":"acsp_v2_digest_calculation","id":5},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature protocol","hash":"raw_digest_signature_protocol","id":6},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature request parameters","hash":"raw_digest_signature_request_parameters","id":7},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE digest value","hash":"raw_digest_signature_digest_calculation","id":8},{"text":"RAW_DIGEST_SIGNATURE signature response parameters","hash":"_raw_digest_signature_signature_response_parameters","id":9}]},"92":{"id":92,"text":"See more how to test device-link flows EndResult Country Document Number Comment OK EE LT LV BE PNOEE-40404040009-MOCK-Q PNOLT-40404040009-MOCK-Q PNOLV-040404-10003-MOCK-Q PNOBE-04040400287-MOCK-Q Adult OK EE LT LV LV BE PNOEE-61101019999-MOCK-Q PNOLT-61101019999-MOCK-Q PNOLV-020211-12343-MOCK-Q PNOLV-320000-00008-MOCK-Q PNOBE-11010199815-MOCK-Q Minor OK LT LV PNOLT-61101019988-MOCK-NQ PNOLV-020211-12351-MOCK-NQ Minor EndResult Country Document Number Comment OK EE LT LV LV BE PNOEE-40504040001-DEMO-Q PNOLT-40504040001-MOCK-Q PNOLV-050405-10009-DEMO-Q PNOLV-320000-10003-MOCK-Q PNOBE-05040400032-DEMO-Q Issued using: TEST of SK ID Solutions EID-Q 2024E OK LT LV PNOLT-40504049999-MOCK-NQ PNOLV-050404-19993-DEMO-NQ Issued using: TEST of SK ID Solutions EID-NQ 2021E OK EE LT LV BE PNOEE-50001029996-DEMO-Q PNOLT-50001029996-DEMO-Q PNOLV-020100-29990-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010299944-MOCK-Q Adult OK LT PNOLT-30303039914-MOCK-Q OK EE LT LV BE PNOEE-39901012239-MOCK-Q PNOLT-39901012239-DEMO-Q PNOLV-030303-10215-MOCK-Q PNOBE-99010199987-DEMO-Q User has other active account OK EE LT LV LV PNOEE-61101012257-MOCK-Q PNOLT-61101012257-MOCK-Q PNOLV-010111-23474-DEMD-Q PNOLV-320000-00032-MOCK-Q User age is under 18 (2011-01-01) OK LV PNOLV-030303-10004-MOCK-Q No numbers in names OK LV PNOLV-040404-19999-MOCK-Q OK LV PNOLV-040404-19980-MOCK-Q OK LV PNOLV-311299-19993-MOCK-Q PNOLV-329999-99901-MOCK-Q dateOfBirth in separate field OK LV PNOLV-329999-99709-MOCK-Q No dateOfBirth in separate field OK LT LV PNOLT-49912318881-MOCK-NQ PNOLV-311299-18886-MOCK-NQ USER_REFUSED EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039917-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039917-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10016-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010238349-MOCK-Q USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039928-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039928-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10024-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010267350-MOCK-Q details.interaction: \"displayTextAndPIN\" v2 response USER_REFUSED_DISPLAYTEXTANDPIN v1 response USER_REFUSED USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039939-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039939-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10032-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010266756-MOCK-Q details.interaction: \"verificationCodeChoice\" v2 response USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION_VC_CHOICE v1 response USER_REFUSED USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039946-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039946-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10040-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010232708-MOCK-Q details.interaction: \"confirmationMessage\" v2 response USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE v1 response USER_REFUSED USER_REFUSED_INTERACTION EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039950-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039950-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10059-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010211724-MOCK-Q details.interaction: \"confirmationMessageAndVerificationCodeChoice\" v2 response USER_REFUSED_CONFIRMATIONMESSAGE_WITH_VC_CHOICE v1 response USER_REFUSED WRONG_VC EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039972-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039972-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10075-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010216276-MOCK-Q TIMEOUT EE LT LV BE PNOEE-30403039983-MOCK-Q PNOLT-30403039983-MOCK-Q PNOLV-030403-10083-MOCK-Q PNOBE-00010220335-MOCK-Q","title":"Test accounts for automated testing","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"test_accounts","url":"/test_accounts.html","titles":[{"text":"Device link flows","hash":"_device_link_flows","id":1},{"text":"Notification flows","hash":"_notification_flows","id":2}]},"93":{"id":93,"text":".doc .ulist li+li { margin-top: 0; } .doc details>summary::before { border-width: .3em .5em .3em; Released: 2025-08-25 Fixed App Usage broken with iOS 26 beta Fix wrong theme after device link transaction.

Smart-ID is the next generation solution for managing your identity online. With Smart-ID you can log into 3rd party websites and give legally valid digital signature. Smart-ID works in your mobile phone or tablet and doesn’t require specially issued SIM-card. The demo version has the following functionality: User can use Smart-ID to log into the website (bank123 demo portal). User can log in Smart-ID self-service portal https://sid.demo.sk.ee/portal and get an overview of accounts and to delete an account. User can log in to any test e-service which is integrated with Smart-ID demo service. For using demo environment there is need to install Smart-ID demo app. Getting Smart-ID up and running is easy. Follow those easy 4 steps: Registration & Installation Install demo app on Android platform (minimum Android 5 required): https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.stagnationlab.sk Steps to install on iOS (minimum iOS13 required): Download Testflight https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8 Join Smart-ID demo beta app in https://testflight.apple.com/join/DoWddZjR Start the app Start the Smart-ID app and choose the Register button. Prove your identity For beta version, you can choose to prove your identity via provided bank links. Just make your selection, and you’ll be redirected to the bank’s Internet bank, and you are asked to log in with different tokens. Using bank link as a registration method means, that you will be granted Smart-ID Basic account. Using ID-card or mobile-ID means, that you will be receiving a Smart-ID Qualified account. Smart-ID Basic can be used only by IDP-s (banks), so we suggest preferring ID-card or Mobile-ID as a registration. After successful login, you’ll arrive back in the app, just confirm that your name and national identification number is correct. If you don’t have supported bank account, you can still try out the app by entering your personal data manually. If you do have Estonian personal ID-code, then you are not eligible for manual registration. Use 'Other country' instead if you prefer manual registration. Negative side here is, that you will receive randomly generated personal code, which makes testing more difficult (have to remember that personal code). Enter your PIN1 and PIN2 The app asks for your PIN1 and PIN2 code. PIN1 is for protecting your authentication key pair and PIN2 is for protecting your signature key pair, same way as with ID-card and Mobile-ID. You can choose the random codes, generated by app, or enter your own favorite PIN code Either way, make sure you remember the codes afterwards. Install sample bank123 app App demonstrates same device usecase how Smart-ID app is automatically opened from another app. Get app for Android platform Join on Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smart_id.bank123 Join on the web https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.smart_id.bank123 Get app for iOS platform by joining https://testflight.apple.com/join/oAeBWz8l Your Smart-ID account is now ready to use. If you have iOS watch with watchOS 8.5 or later, then you can test Smart-ID from the watch as well. To see the Smart-ID in action and to actually use it to log into a website and give the digital signature, you can try the following beta services. https://smid.demo.sk.ee Bank123 demo portal to demonstrate Smart-ID for online banking services https://beta.dokobit.com/ Dokobit BETA to demonstrate Smart-ID usage for signing https://sid.demo.sk.ee/portal/login Smart-ID demo portal Cross-device QR flow Open page from computer browser → “Enter Smart-ID portal (Smart-ID)” → \"Sign in using Smart-ID QR code\" Open Smart-ID app and press button “Scan QR code” to init QR scanner and scan the QR code.

User may see the following error messages when using old Smart-ID app with new flows: Same-device flows - fallback page Cross-device flow - Invalid QR code Where should I start to integrate Smart-ID to my e-service? In case you are using Java development framework, the easiest way to do the integration is to use our \"free to use\" client libraries. When you are using some other development framework, please read our API description. The Smart-ID integration API is based on JSON/REST and it’s easy to use from all the major nowadays development frameworks. For development purposes we have a publicly available demo environment, you don’t need any agreement for implementing Smart-ID support. For accessing the production service you should have an agreement. More information about service agreements and prices is available here. How long does it usually take to implement Smart-ID support? We have got feedback from developers and e-service providers that implementing Smart-ID authentication is easy and usually it takes one to two days. The signing process is more complicated and the amount of development work needed depends on your current implementation. In case there is document signing based on ID-card already in place, adding the Smart-ID support should take up to one week. Is there a possibility to get support during Smart-ID integration? Yes, we are happy to provide you free support for integrating the Smart-ID. Please contact us via support@sk.ee. What are the “ServiceName” and “RPUUID” parameters and what kind of values should I use there? These are unique identifiers of the e-service provider. The e-service provider name is displayed to the end-user in Smart-ID app during authentication and signing. The service provider should inform SK of the ServiceName that will be used. The RPUUID is service internal parameter that is provided by SK to the e-service provider. Both parameters are fixed in agreement between e-service provider and SK ID Solutions. What are the options for implementing automated tests for the Smart-ID integration? For making automated integration testing easier there are Smart-ID auto-responder test accounts here. These accounts are returning pre-defined status codes and responses according to specifications. This means that you don’t have to automate Smart-ID app side during the testing, this is already done by SK. Is the app-2-app integration available? Yes. See more. What information contains the Smart-ID certificate? Detailed info is at document Certificate and OCSP Profile for Smart-ID available at https://www.sk.ee/en/repository/profiles/ Where can I find users personal code? User’s personal code can be found from certificate’s attribute SERIALNUMBER. This attribute can contain personal number, a national identity card number or passport number. NB! Please do not use personal code from certificate’s Common Name (CN) field. Newer certificates contain only surName (SN) and givenName (G) in CN field. Where can I find users date of birth? Birth of date is encoded into personal identity code. Latvian new personal identity code format is exception thow. Special birth of date field will be added to Smart-ID certificates in stages and only for QUALIFIED accounts. For convinience smart-id-java-client and smart-id-php-client have special function getDateOfBirth and getDateOfBirth for that. For getting that info directly from certificate see getDateOfBirthCertificateAttribute and getDateOfBirthFromCertificateField","title":"Frequently Asked
