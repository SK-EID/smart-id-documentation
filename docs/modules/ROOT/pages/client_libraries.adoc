= Client libraries

[IMPORTANT]
We do not have client libraries available for latest RP API v3 yet!

[NOTE]
New documentation includes many code samples in different languages.

See xref:rp-api:ROOT:device_link_flows.adoc#_same-device_flows[same-device flows], xref:rp-api:ROOT:device_link_flows.adoc#_cross-device_flows[cross-device flows]

[NOTE]
This PHP client cannot be used to create digitally signed containers because PHP does not have a library like DigiDoc4J.
